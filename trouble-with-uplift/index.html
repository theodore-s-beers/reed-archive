    <section id="body-text">
      <p>
        Occasionally, on a boring flight, I&#x2019;ll rewatch the Battle of
        James Island scene from the magnificent 1989 film, <em>Glory</em>. The
        scene depicts the first engagement of the 54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts
        Infantry, the first Northern regiment of black troops organized by the
        Army of the United States to fight against the Confederate insurrection.
        James Island was a fateful battle outside Charleston, SC, on July 16,
        1863. I pulled up the clip on a recent flight and was moved yet again by
        the powerful imagery of black men finally able to strike a blow against
        the slaveocracy. Imagining what that felt like for the soldiers of the
        54<sup>th</sup> is always intensely gratifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching it this time, I remembered how startled I had been when
        <em>Glory</em> was released to learn that many people, including blacks
        and people on the left, dismissed or even disparaged the film as a
        &#x201C;white savior narrative&#x201D;&#x2014;a phrase that is now a
        routine derogation of certain cross-racial sagas of resistance to white
        supremacy. In <em>Glory</em>&#x2019;s case, this complaint arose mainly
        in response to the (historically accurate) depiction of the
        regiment&#x2019;s commanding officers as Northern whites.
      </p>
      <p>
        This objection left me dumbfounded. After all, the 54<sup>th</sup>
        Massachusetts was a real historical entity. As a compromise to ensure
        political support, it was stipulated that its officers be white.
        Nonetheless, prominent abolitionists, including Frederick Douglass and
        the free black community of Boston, were enthusiastic about its
        formation and instrumental in recruiting its ranks.
      </p>
      <h2>The Myth of the Birth of the Hero</h2>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding some artistic license (<em>e.g.</em>, including freed
        slaves within the 54<sup>th</sup>, when it was actually composed
        entirely of free black men), <em>Glory</em>&#x2019;s director Edward
        Zwick clearly intended it to be an historical film. How could it not
        feature white officers?
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, the indictment of <em>Glory</em> as white-savior
        propaganda was common on the left&#x2014;with the allied claim that the
        story was told largely through the eyes of the regiment&#x2019;s young
        commander, Col. Robert Gould Shaw, who was killed leading the
        54<sup>th</sup>&#x2019;s attack on the Confederate South Carolina
        stronghold, Ft. Wagner. Leaving aside the fact that more black
        characters than white ones have autonomous voices and personalities, the
        film was largely based on Shaw&#x2019;s moving letters home, which were
        compiled in the volume <em>Blue-Eyed Child of Fortune</em>. All such
        judgments are idiosyncratic, to be sure, but I was left scratching my
        head at the ideologically charged reaction to what may be the greatest
        American film ever made&#x2014;certainly greater than two others that
        have been so judged: <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, D.&#xA0;W.
        Griffith&#x2019;s 1915 paean to white supremacy and the Ku Klux Klan,
        and its update for the talkie era, <em>Gone with the Wind</em>. I could
        not understand at the time how <em>Glory</em>&#x2019;s critics seemed to
        miss or make light of such a powerful depiction of popular black
        political agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I think I understand. I&#x2019;ve long suspected that, to a certain
        strain of race-conscious or antiracist discourse, historical exploration
        in popular culture was less important than the propagation of tales of
        inspiration and uplift. These fables typically feature singular black
        heroes who have overcome crushing racist adversity against all odds. In
        recent years, a steady stream of films and other narratives have openly
        embraced that preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have written elsewhere about several of them. Producer George Lucas
        touted his execrable, cartoonish depiction of World War II&#x2019;s
        Tuskegee Airmen, <em>Red Tails</em> (2012), as a work spotlighting
        &#x201C;real heroes&#x201D; who would be &#x201C;inspirational for
        teenage boys&#x201D; and compared it favorably to
        &#x201C;<em>Glory</em>, where you have a lot of white officers running
        those guys into cannon fodder.&#x201D; And Quentin Tarantino&#x2019;s
        2012 race film <em>Django Unchained</em> reduced slavery and manumission
        to the antics of a spaghetti-Western-style hero who in fact never
        challenges slavery but fixates only on rescuing his wife. Ava DuVernay
        acknowledged that she intentionally falsified the history of the iconic
        voting-rights campaign in her 2014 film <em>Selma</em> to deny President
        Lyndon Johnson&#x2019;s role because she &#x201C;wasn&#x2019;t
        interested in making a white-savior movie.&#x201D; As a consequence, she
        also misrepresented the tensions between Martin Luther King,
        Jr.&#xA0;and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and the
        Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) activists in the
        campaign&#x2014;which had precisely to do with King&#x2019;s
        surreptitious negotiations with Johnson. The effect of omitting such a
        central tactical debate was to depict the civil rights struggle as a
        simple extrusion of King&#x2019;s larger-than-life persona against a
        pandemic racism&#x2014;as a struggle, in other words, with virtually no
        politics to speak of.
      </p>
      <h2>Nation-Building</h2>
      <p>
        Nate Parker&#x2019;s 2016 dramatization of the 1831 Virginia slave
        rebellion led by Nat Turner, <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> (which quite
        intentionally sets itself up as an answer to Griffith&#x2019;s film from
        a century earlier), is an even more strident display of the inclination
        to subordinate the complexities of actual history to a narrative of
        black heroism in the face of universal and unremitting white supremacy
        and racism. As Kenneth W. Warren argues in the
        <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          For Parker&#xA0;&#x2026; the point of history is not so much to figure
          out what really happened but rather to enable reparative and
          redemptive mythmaking&#x2026; A further entailment of Parker&#x2019;s
          view of his achievement is that history, for him, must remain
          narrow&#x2014;a conduit for inspiration or therapy, for bequeathing
          legacies, or for purveying information or misinformation to the
          present&#x2014;and not much more. Parker&#x2019;s understanding of
          what makes Turner heroic is that he resisted his oppression and that
          his act of resistance can serve as a model for the rest of us.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Warren readily concedes that Parker, though clearly knowing of them, had
        no obligation to broaden his narrative to include such entailments.
        Still, it&#x2019;s far from inconsequential to note the political legacy
        of Turner&#x2019;s 1831 uprising; in the state that would later serve as
        the capital of the Confederacy, whites launched a searching debate over
        the possibility of manumission. Warren quotes Stephen Oates&#x2019;s
        <em>The Fires of Jubilee: Nat Turner&#x2019;s Fierce Rebellion</em>
        (1975), which notes that &#x201C;in the western part of the state, where
        antislavery and anti-Negro sentiment had long been stirring, whites held
        public rallies in which they openly endorsed emancipation&#x2014;yes,
        the liberation of all of Virginia&#x2019;s 470,000 slaves&#x2014;as the
        only safeguard in these dangerous times.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, those discussions did not succeed in ending slavery in
        Virginia. However, as Warren notes, &#x201C;they point to a truth rarely
        narrated about the South, namely, that it has never been as solidly
        pro-slavery or even as anti-black as popular imagination has depicted
        it&#x201D;; he goes on to cite as a crucial case in point the rise of
        the interracial Readjuster Party, which wrested electoral power from
        planter elites and governed Virginia from 1879 to 1883&#x2014;nearly two
        decades after the antislavery western counties seceded to form West
        Virginia.
      </p>
      <p>
        &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not suggesting that Parker should be held responsible
        for incorporating these events into his story&#x2014;there&#x2019;s
        nothing wrong with keeping his lens trained on the Turner
        rebellion,&#x201D; Warren writes. &#x201C;But I am saying there&#x2019;s
        no evidence that, in trying to think about what confronting the past
        might do for us, Parker ever looked beyond the obvious, both in terms of
        the story he told and the narrative techniques he employed to tell
        us.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        The film&#x2019;s concluding scene drives home this point in
        unmistakable terms, dissolving away from a weeping black boy observing
        Turner&#x2019;s execution into the Union soldier he will become, as if
        inspired directly by Turner&#x2019;s sacrifice&#x2014;sidestepping
        virtually all the actual history that <em>Glory</em> tries to reckon
        with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warren also contrasts Parker&#x2019;s vision to the one that animates
        Gary Ross&#x2019;s underappreciated 2016 film,
        <em>Free State of Jones</em>, which was also widely dismissed on its
        release as just another white-savior narrative. The film&#x2019;s
        narrative indeed centered on the character of Newton Knight, a white
        Mississippi farmer and Confederate deserter who, as Warren notes,
        &#x201C;leads an interracial insurgency of runaway slaves and yeoman
        farmers against the Confederacy and its planter elites in southeastern
        Mississippi, where for a brief shining moment they establish the Free
        State of Jones.&#x201D; Ross traces the surprisingly robust efforts of
        the Knight insurgency to institutionalize a new, egalitarian regime, and
        proceeds to chronicle its defeat during the period of Presidential
        Reconstruction, which restored the Mississippi planter class into power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, just as with the early dismissals of <em>Glory</em>, the
        caricatures of <em>Free State of Jones</em> as a one-note study in white
        saviorship bears no resemblance to the film in question and its
        historically nuanced narrative. For example,
        <em>Free State</em> includes perhaps the only filmic representation ever
        of freedpeople&#x2019;s self-organization via the Union League&#x2014;a
        key chapter in early Southern postbellum efforts to create an
        anti-planter coalition of biracial workers&#x2019; parties that the
        chorus of kneejerk &#x201C;white savior&#x201D; dismissals tellingly
        overlooks. Knight and the members of his insurgency were actual
        historical figures, and Ross&#x2019;s narrative is generally faithful to
        the actual history in which they were embedded and which they made. So,
        as in <em>Glory</em>, the only way to narrate the story without Knight
        as the central dramatis persona would be to abandon historical accuracy;
        doing so would require a fantasy more on the order of
        <em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em>, perhaps replacing Lincoln with
        Frederick Douglass for good measure. (The &#x201C;white savior&#x201D;
        dismissal actually may have reached its apotheosis in the preposterous
        assertion that neither Lincoln, the Union army, nor Congress ended
        slavery but, rather, the slaves somehow &#x201C;freed
        themselves&#x201D;&#x2014;to cite a frequent criticism of another film
        widely dismissed on white saviorship grounds, Steven Spielberg&#x2019;s
        2012 biopic <em>Lincoln</em>. The political sensibility underlying such
        an assertion betrays a hostility to institutional politics and the role
        of government that one would expect to find deep inside a survivalist
        bunker.)
      </p>
      <h2>Waiting for Superman</h2>
      <p>
        This year&#x2019;s blockbuster, Ryan Coogler&#x2019;s
        <em>Black Panther</em>, takes the further step of jettisoning history
        altogether and rendering the narrative of black heroism&#x2014;in fact
        Superheroism&#x2014;in the realm of pure fantasy. Coogler intends the
        mythical African nation of Wakanda to be black Americans&#x2019;
        &#x201C;fairy tale version of Africa,&#x201D; as he told an interviewer
        for <em>Rolling Stone</em>. &#x201C;We were kings and queens, and we
        walked around and ate perfect food, and everyone was free.&#x201D;
        Revealingly, the Superhero from which the film (like the comic book from
        which it is derived) draws its name is a king, and the conflict with his
        supervillain antagonist is rooted in a struggle over monarchical
        succession. Everyone was only as free as the king would permit them to
        be, in other words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever Coogler&#x2019;s auteurish intentions to render
        <em>Black Panther</em> a fable of American black empowerment, its
        release triggered an all-too-familiar torrent of hype that alchemizes
        the collective struggle for racial justice into still one more praise
        song hymning a hyperindividualist hero Challenging Stultifyingly Generic
        White Oppression and Overcoming It Against All Odds. Literature
        professor Salamishah Tillet, writing in the <em>New York Times</em> on
        the film&#x2019;s release, approvingly quotes Jonathan Gray&#x2019;s
        summary of the film&#x2019;s fan-boy appeal:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Now there you have every black boy&#x2019;s fantasy. He is richer than
          Bill Gates, smarter than Elon Musk, better looking than Denzel&#x2026;
          He is the hereditary ruler of the richest nation on Earth. The movie
          is about wish fulfillment. When you see Bruce Wayne, this dashing
          billionaire, where is the black version of that? You got
          T&#x2019;Challa.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        On the breathless extreme of the spectrum, commercial imperative and
        outsized political claims fuse into an indistinguishable unity; phony
        liberationist calls to respond to obvious marketing and merchandising
        tie-in ploys&#x2014;<em>e.g.</em>, guides for identifying and purchasing
        replicas of &#x201C;African&#x201D; artifacts and styles displayed in
        T&#x2019;Challa&#x2019;s kingdom and guides for &#x201C;mapping
        Wakanda&#x201D;&#x2014;urge participation in the commercial hype machine
        as though it were a form of political engagement. Amid this marketing
        land rush, the irony scarcely registers that the separatist monarchy of
        Wakanda was invented by two white men, Stan Lee and Jack Kirbye&#x2014;a
        considerable challenge to the race-first rhetoric of white-savior
        spotters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, <em>Black Panther</em> did not invent this conflation of
        Hollywood consumerism with racial uplift; it&#x2019;s merely cashed in
        on it. This cynical maneuver has figured prominently in the promotion of
        a host of politically reactionary films like
        <em>Waiting for &#x201C;Superman&#x201D;</em> (2010),
        <em>Won&#x2019;t Back Down</em> (2012), and
        <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild</em> (2012), each of which sold seeing
        the film and talking it up to one&#x2019;s friends as something akin to
        political movement-building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parker&#x2019;s and Coogler&#x2019;s films are innovative in one sense,
        however; they each foreground the specific ideological program that
        arises out of the anti-historical celebration of individual black
        heroism. To be sure, their appeal conforms to a general formula of
        escapist entertainment that&#x2019;s by no means limited to black
        cultural expression&#x2014;the Hero Overcoming Against All Odds. And
        many black people, both autonomously and with the prod of cultural cues,
        no doubt derive a particular satisfaction from racial identification
        with themes and characters&#x2014;however fleeting such pleasure may be
        in the frenzied marketing of images and brands in the American
        omni-entertainment state.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets the contemporary genre of inspirational black hero films apart
        is the way the fantasies they enact connect with the race-first
        sensibilities prominent among black and other professional-managerial
        strata. These race commentators share a body of ideological assumptions
        and material interests, deeply invested in parsing, interpreting, and
        administering inequality in terms of racial disparities. Specifically,
        this genre of critique typically looks to measure and remediate the
        exclusion of black professionals from traditionally white power elites.
        Identifying the tacit social agenda embedded in the &#x201C;white savior
        narrative&#x201D; charge brings us to the heart of the matter.

        play in <em>Selma</em>, may give the impression that the detractors of
        white saviorship are voicing a populist sensibility, complaining that
        black people are represented as incapable of effective social action
        without a white person (usually a man) leading them. And there is ample
        precedent in the history of popular culture for suspicion in that
        regard. The Tarzan films are perhaps the crassest and best-known
        examples; my father often remarked sarcastically that Africans should be
        grateful for Tarzan&#x2019;s presence, since otherwise they apparently
        would all have been eaten by lions and crocodiles. The 1988 film
        <em>Mississippi Burning</em> incongruously makes FBI agents (white,
        though does that really matter?) the heroes of the civil rights
        campaign. Richard Attenborough&#x2019;s 1987
        <em>Cry Freedom</em> describes the struggle against apartheid and the
        murder of Stephen Biko through the travails of his white friend, the
        journalist Donald Woods. And there are many more examples; it is in fact
        the long history of such narratives that makes what might otherwise be
        simple feel-good stories, presented with an interracial twist&#x2014;<em
          >Conrack</em
        >
        (1974), <em>Dangerous Minds</em> (1995), and
        <em>The Blind Side</em> (2009), among many others&#x2014;something more
        distasteful and pernicious than just a set of interchangeable thematic
        variations on the maudlin human-interest narrative of uplift and
        overcoming.
      </p>
      <p>
        But &#x201C;white savior&#x201D; objections to <em>Glory</em> and
        <em>Free State</em> are a different matter. Those films hinge largely on
        the prominence of black agency, which race-first critics apparently deem
        irrelevant. Their objection is not that blacks&#x2019; agency is absent;
        it is rather about who is represented as leading their efforts.
        Decisions by blacks to support nonblack candidates or social policies
        not expressed in race-first terms are interpreted as evidence of flawed,
        limited, misguided, or otherwise co-opted black agency. The idea that
        blacks, like everyone else, make their history under conditions not of
        their own choosing becomes irrelevant, just another instance of
        insufficient symbolic representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The notion that black Americans are political agents just like other
        Americans, and can forge their own tactical alliances and coalitions to
        advance their interests in a pluralist political order, is ruled out
        here on principle. Instead, blacks are imagined as so abject that only
        extraordinary intervention by committed black leaders has a prayer of
        producing real change. This pernicious assumption continually
        subordinates actually existing history to imaginary cultural narratives
        of individual black heroism and helps drive the intense&#x2014;and
        myopic&#x2014;opposition that many antiracist activists and commentators
        express to Bernie Sanders, social democracy, and a politics centered on
        economic inequality and working-class concerns.
      </p>
      <h2>Class Is Dismissed</h2>
      <p>
        The striking hostility to such a politics within the higher reaches of
        antiracist activism illustrates the extent to which what bills itself as
        black politics today is in fact a class politics: it is not interested
        in the concerns of working people of whatever race or gender. Indeed, a
        spate of recent media reports have retailed evidence that upper-class
        black Americans may be experiencing stagnant-to-declining social
        mobility&#x2014;which is taken as prima facie evidence of the stubbornly
        racist cast of the American social order:
        <em>Even rich professionals like us</em>, elite commentators suggest,
        <em>are denied the right to secure our own class standing</em>. It is
        also telling that the study that provoked the media reports&#x2014;Raj
        Chetty, <em>et al</em>., &#x201C;Race and Economic Opportunity in the
        United States: An Intergenerational Perspective&#x201D;&#x2014;rehearses
        the hoary recommendation that &#x201C;reducing the intergenerational
        persistence of the black-white income gap will require policies whose
        impacts cross neighborhood and class lines and increase upward mobility
        specifically for black men.&#x201D; These include &#x201C;mentoring
        programs for black boys, efforts to reduce racial bias among whites, or
        efforts to facilitate social interaction across racial groups within a
        given area.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s pretty thin gruel, warmed over
        bromides and all too familiar paternalism and no actually redistributive
        policies at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context the pronounced animus trained on the figure of the
        &#x201C;white savior&#x201D; emerges as litmus test for the critical
        role of racial gatekeeper in respectable political discourse. The
        gatekeeping question has, for more than a century, focused on who speaks
        for black Americans and determines the &#x201C;black agenda.&#x201D; And
        the status of black leader, spokesperson, or &#x201C;voice&#x201D; has
        always been a direct function of contested class prerogative, dating
        back a century and more to Booker T. Washington, W.&#xA0;E.&#xA0;B. Du
        Bois, Ida B. Wells, and Anna Julia Cooper. Specifically, the gatekeeping
        function is the obsession of the professional-managerial strata who
        pursue what Warren has described as &#x201C;managerial authority over
        the nation&#x2019;s Negro problem.&#x201D; How do &#x201C;black
        leaders&#x201D; become recognized? The answer is the same now as for
        Washington in the 1890s; recognition as a legitimate black leader, or
        &#x201C;voice,&#x201D; requires ratification by elite opinion-shaping
        institutions and individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gatekeeping hasn&#x2019;t been the exclusive preoccupation of Bookerite
        conservatives or liberals like Du Bois. Even militant black nationalists
        and racial separatists like Marcus Garvey and the leaders of the Nation
        of Islam have pursued validation as black leaders from dominant white
        elites to support programs of racial &#x201C;self-help&#x201D; or
        uplift. From Black Power to Black Lives Matter, claimants to speak on
        behalf of the race have courted recognition from the Ford Foundation and
        other white-dominated nonprofit philanthropies and NGOs. And the
        emergence of cable news networks and the blogosphere have exponentially
        expanded the number and types of entities that can anoint race leaders
        and representative voices.
      </p>
      <p>
        This new welter of platforms and voices seeking to promulgate and
        validate the acceptable terms of black leadership has made the category
        seem all the more beyond question, as black racial voices pop up all
        over the place all the time. So, for example, the self-proclaimed black
        voice Tia Oso was brought front and center in the 2015 Netroots
        Presidential Town Hall featuring Martin O&#x2019;Malley and Bernie
        Sanders, where she proclaimed that &#x201C;black leadership must be
        foregrounded and central to progressive strategies.&#x201D; Likewise,
        the presumed moral authority of race leadership enabled Marissa Johnson
        and Mara Jacqueline Willaford to prevent Sanders from speaking at a
        Social Security rally in Seattle&#x2014;as though the long-term
        viability of Social Security were not a black issue. The instant
        recourse to a posture of leadership is how random Black Lives Matter
        activists and a vast corps of pundits and bloggers are able to issue
        <em>ex cathedra</em> declarations about which issues are and are not
        pertinent to black Americans.
      </p>
      <h2>Voices in a Political Vacuum</h2>
      <p>
        The freelance black leader&#x2014;and its more recent, superficially
        more pluralist incarnation, the black &#x201C;voice&#x201D;&#x2014;is a
        legacy harking back to the era of massive black disfranchisement at the
        end of the nineteenth century. It also has drawn considerable staying
        power from the amorphous concept of &#x201C;race relations,&#x201D;
        according to which, in the judgment of historian Michael R. West in his
        2006 study <em>The Education of Booker T. Washington</em>,
        &#x201C;blacks and whites&#x2014;or &#x2018;black America&#x2019; and
        &#x2018;white America&#x2019;&#x2014;are basic, indivisible units of
        political interest&#x2026; The race relations framework appealed to
        white elites because it sidestepped the troublesome fact of
        blacks&#x2019; constitutional claims to full and equal citizenship by
        proposing a focus on the evanescent issue of how the
        &#x2018;races&#x2019; relate as an alternative to matters like denial of
        rights and equal protection under the law.&#x201D; West also notes that
        &#x201C;interests and aspirations of politicians and ministers, workers
        and businessmen, parents and teachers would no longer be expressed by
        way of the normal, if potentially messy, institutional channels through
        which Americans settled their conflicts and competition. Instead, they
        would be mediated through the good offices of &#x2018;Negro
        leaders,&#x2019; ever mindful of where their mandate comes from and the
        requirement placed on them as a first principle &#x2018;to cement the
        friendship of the two races.&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; The warrant to
        cement the friendship of the races, of course, meant framing racial
        comity on terms acceptable to the dominant white elites who ratified
        claims to black leadership and decided which of those claims were
        &#x201C;responsible&#x201D; or &#x201C;right-thinking.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        The race-relations mindset also shaped the ideological outlook of racial
        advocacy and uplift groups like the National Urban League and the
        National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Both groups,
        for example, were hesitant to support labor organization for black
        workers during the Great Depression since they relied on donations from
        liberal funders steeped in anti-union sentiments; also, apostles of
        racial uplift tended to come from a professional-managerial background
        themselves, again highlighting the extent to which there has always been
        a class dimension to black politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this is to suggest that claimants to race leadership even in the
        Bookerite era were dupes or supplicants who were not sincerely committed
        &#x201C;race men&#x201D; and &#x201C;race women&#x201D; in the parlance
        of the time. Rather, as Warren, West, and others have argued, the
        stratum of the black population that tended to incubate aspiring race
        leaders also cohered around views of proper racial agendas&#x2014;what
        the &#x201C;race&#x201D; needed and how its position in the world could
        be advanced, <em>i.e.</em>, what constituted
        &#x201C;uplift&#x201D;&#x2014;that also reflected the priorities of
        philanthropic elites. These mutually dependent groups were likely to
        share a baseline sense of how American society should be
        structured&#x2014;and specifically of how to manage existing class
        hierarchies so as to better navigate blacks&#x2019; place within them.
        That said, most racial advocates were doubtless more committed than
        their patrons to the pursuit of full equality of opportunity.
      </p>
      <h2>The Revolution Will Be Televised</h2>
      <p>
        The terms of this tacit social contract shifted with the victories of
        the civil rights movement and the cultural insurgencies of the 1960s and
        1970s; suddenly, raw racial subordination no longer commanded uncritical
        assent from the liberal wing of the American power elite. At the same
        time, though, this civil rights revolution and its aftermath worked to
        obscure the striking continuity in the underlying socioeconomic dynamics
        that continue to validate race leaders, spokespersons, or representative
        voices. The open&#x2014;or at least public&#x2014;performance of
        supplication before powerful elites is no longer necessary or desirable
        for validation. Indeed, Black Power &#x201C;militancy&#x201D; and
        various cultural-separatist projects aligned with black nationalism
        supported new claimants&#x2019; discourse of authenticity&#x2014;one
        that gained wider credence via assertive demands for equal power instead
        of humble requests for recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the surface, at least, it now appeared that the essentially dependent
        relation between white liberal arbiters or power and their black
        counterparts had morphed into something more radical. And this new
        assertive liturgy of dependence works to the benefit of both grantors
        and grantees of political legitimacy and economic largess&#x2014;players
        who all shared a stake in projecting an appearance of the
        anointed&#x2019;s racial authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, this liturgy is everywhere on display&#x2014;along with the same
        power dynamics that sustain it. In academic institutions and programs,
        op-ed pages, magazines and blogs, and of course cable television
        newschat programs, we see a steady stream of racial voices and leaders
        plotting out the permissible boundaries of black authenticity and black
        leadership values. This surface accord within the charmed circle of
        <em>soi-disant</em> black leaders reinforces the illusion, just as was
        the case in the aftermath of the civil rights era, that they have all
        emerged from the grassroots.
      </p>
      <p>
        The increasing significance of the corporate newsfotainment industry
        means that things could scarcely seem otherwise to most casual viewers
        and audiences. The leading platforms of respectable black
        discourse&#x2014;including the various internet platforms that encourage
        freelance chatter&#x2014;reinforce the sense that those purporting to
        express the black point of view arise naturally from within the
        quasi-mythic &#x201C;black community.&#x201D; But of course the
        immediacy of all these venues, despite their many claims to have
        vanquished old-guard &#x201C;gatekeepers&#x201D; and &#x201C;legacy
        media&#x201D; forums, has rendered the selection processes behind the
        elevation of this or that leadership &#x201C;voice&#x201D; almost
        completely opaque. Not all points of view can gain a hearing, after all.
        Terms like &#x201C;responsible&#x201D; and
        &#x201C;right-thinking&#x201D; seldom slip into public discussion
        anymore because they evoke explicit subordination; nevertheless,
        sporadic calls for recognized black voices to distance themselves from
        &#x201C;extremist&#x201D; or otherwise unacceptable views expressed by
        other black &#x201C;voices&#x201D;&#x2014;most recently via another
        predictably vile anti-Semitic utterance from Nation of Islam leader
        Louis Farrakhan&#x2014;reveal that such criteria are critical in setting
        the boundaries of public legitimacy for aspiring black leaders. Another
        telling instance of the same dynamic ocurred when Keith Ellison, the
        African American Muslim congressman from Minnesota, sought to chair the
        Democratic National Committee as a Sanders supporter; here again, the
        sensible centrist consensus counteroffensive depicted Ellison as simply
        too fringe and divisive a figure to command authority in the sacred
        political mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside the close vetting of respectable black voices in the media
        mainstream there&#x2019;s been a prolonged atrophy of popular political
        mobilization behind issues of economic equity for black Americans. Taken
        together, these trends have opened a shortcut path to broader public
        recognition for self-styled race leaders. For more than a decade, it has
        been common to encounter young people who enter graduate programs in
        order to prepare for careers as racial voices or &#x201C;public
        intellectuals,&#x201D; hoping to obtain a credential that can procure
        valuable space on the <em>Huffington Post</em>, the <em>Root</em>, or
        MSNBC. In the quest for mediagenic legitimacy, some eager race pundits
        have launched organizations that are barely more than letterhead or
        r&#xE9;sum&#xE9; entries; these feints are likewise often accompanied by
        Potemkin-style protest activism, including many of the donor-driven
        groups aligned with Black Lives Matter, or glorified photo-ops intended
        to evoke mass agitation. Among this cohort of racial voices, the
        essential qualification for recognition seems to be inclination to
        declaim on the intractability of an undifferentiated, ahistorical racism
        as a fetter on all black Americans&#x2019; life chances across the sweep
        of the nation&#x2019;s history. As a corollary, they&#x2019;re required
        to insist that objection to generic racial disparities constitutes the
        totality of black political concerns.
      </p>
      <h2>Reduced and Abandoned</h2>
      <p>
        The politics thus advanced is profoundly race-reductionist, discounting
        the value of both political agency and the broad pursuit of political
        alliances within a polity held to be intractably and irredeemably
        devoted to white supremacy. This fatalistic outlook works seamlessly to
        reinforce the status of racial voices who emphasize the interests and
        concerns of a singular racial collectivity. Central to these
        pundits&#x2019; message is the assertion that blacks have it worse, in
        every socio-cultural context that might be adduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        This refrain is also consistent in two important ways with the reigning
        ideology of neoliberal equality. First, the insistence that disparities
        of racial access to power are the most meaningful forms of inequality
        strongly reinforces the neoliberal view that inequalities generated by
        capitalist market forces are natural and lie beyond the scope of
        intervention. And second, if American racism is an intractable,
        transhistorical force&#x2014;indeed, an ontological one, as Ta-Nehisi
        Coates has characterized it&#x2014;then it lies beyond structural
        political intervention. In other words, Coates and other race-firsters
        diminish the significance of the legislative and other institutional
        victories won since Emancipation, leaving us with only exhortations to
        individual conversion and repentance as a program.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why, for example, Coates and other proponents of reparations
        seem unconcerned with the strategic problem of piecing together the kind
        of interracial popular support necessary to actually prevail on the
        issue. Such problems do not exist for them because the role of the
        representative black leader or voice is precisely to function as an
        <em>alternative</em> to political action. Instead, the order of the day
        is typically to perform racial authenticity in a way that doubles as an
        appeal for moral recognition from those with the power to bestow it.
        Winning anything politically&#x2014;policies or changes in power
        relations&#x2014;is not the point. That is why the jeremiads offered by
        contemporary racial voices so commonly boil down to calls for
        &#x201C;conversations about race&#x201D; or equally vapid abstractions
        like &#x201C;racial reckoning&#x201D; or &#x201C;coming to terms
        with&#x201D; a history defined by racism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The black leadership role was always at best an accommodation to
        disfranchisement, going back to its first modern incarnation with Booker
        T. Washington and his cohort of racial advocates. It is a politics of
        elite transaction. That is not in itself necessarily a bad
        thing&#x2014;President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x2019;s &#x201C;black
        cabinet,&#x201D; or Federal Council of Negro Affairs, advised him on
        matters related to black Americans. But unlike today&#x2019;s freelance
        racial voices, they were administration functionaries, and most had
        standing in racial advocacy, education, labor, and government
        institutions prior to joining the &#x201C;cabinet.&#x201D; The backdoor
        dealings between King and Johnson during the Selma campaign that
        DuVernay found too messy to include in her portrait of King&#x2019;s
        heroic persona were also part of mundane political maneuvering, the
        inside-outside game of institutional politics. King and the SCLC, like
        FDR&#x2019;s black cabinet, had constituencies that underwrote their
        standing as representatives of racial interest&#x2014;which in turn gave
        them leverage to make political demands and pursue policy agendas. A.
        Philip Randolph used the March on Washington Movement to pressure
        President Roosevelt in 1941 to issue &#x201C;Executive Order
        8802,&#x201D; prohibiting racial discrimination in the national defense
        industry. Randolph, Bayard Rustin, the Negro American Labor Council, and
        others organized the 1963 March on Washington as part of an
        inside-outside strategy to build support for a jobs program and passage
        of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this painstaking political effort could not be farther from the
        careerist pursuits of contemporary racial voices, whose standing depends
        entirely on the favor of powerful opinion-shaping elites in corporate
        media and elsewhere. Thus, for example, Tour&#xE9; Neblett and others in
        MSNBC&#x2019;s stable were unceremoniously expunged from the lineup of
        talking heads when the network reconfigured its marketing priorities.
        More dramatically, Melissa Harris-Perry, apparently believing that her
        viewing audience gave her leverage, openly rebuffed the network&#x2019;s
        demand to reorient her program to fit in with its election coverage. In
        short order, she and her program vanished without a trace from its
        schedule. Such incidents, and scores of others like them, make it
        indelibly clear where the lines of authority run when it comes to
        winning elite-media recognition as a black voice.
      </p>
      <h2>For Their Own Good</h2>
      <p>
        The race voices I&#x2019;ve discussed express a particular class
        perspective among black Americans, one that harmonizes with
        left-neoliberal notions of justice and equality. That harmony may help
        explain why those racial voices&#x2014;like the black political class in
        general&#x2014;are so intent on disparaging the social-democratic
        politics associated with Bernie Sanders, even though a 2017
        Harvard-Harris survey found that Sanders was far more popular with
        African Americans than with any other demographic category except
        declared Democrats. He boasted a 73 percent favorable rating among black
        voters&#x2014;higher than his approval numbers among Hispanics,
        Asian-Americans, and considerably higher than those for whites or even

        This disjunction between popular opinion and the priorities of the black
        chattering class underscores the extent to which the racial programs and
        priorities advanced by those recognized black voices remain much as they
        were in the Age of Washington. Now as then, we have a leadership stratum
        dedicated to the class-skewed pursuit of &#x201C;managerial authority
        over the nation&#x2019;s Negro problem.&#x201D; And the net effect of
        this top-down model of black discourse is to tether a politics of racial
        representation to the ruling-class agendas that generate and intensify
        inequality and insecurity for working people across American society,
        including among the ranks of black Americans.

        Black Clintonites, like Congressmen John Lewis (D-GA), James Clyburn
        (D-SC) and Cedric Richmond (D-LA), all clearly displayed this commitment
        during the 2016 Democratic primaries when they attacked Sanders as
        &#x201C;irresponsible&#x201D; in calling for non-commodified public
        goods in education, health care, and other areas. Richmond&#x2019;s
        rebuke was especially telling in that he couched it in terms of his role
        as chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and the group&#x2019;s
        &#x201C;responsibility to make sure to know that young people know
        that&#x201D; a social-democratic agenda is &#x201C;too good to be
        true.&#x201D; Richmond&#x2019;s invocation of civic instruction for the
        young may be revealing in another way. Lurking beneath that piety is the
        deeply sedimented common sense of underclass ideology, which posits a
        population mired in pathologies and hemmed in by an overwhelming racism,
        and the corollary of interventions aiming to enhance capabilities for
        individual mobility. (It is, indeed, this same tacit rhetoric of
        permanent crisis that fuels the notion that black young people must be
        raised on a diet of inspirational movies.)

        This vision of unyielding black pathology is yet another testament to
        the harmony of antiracist and neoliberal ideologies&#x2014;and it, too,
        harks directly back to the origins of the black leadership caste at the
        dawn of the last century. Washington and Du Bois, together with Garvey
        and other prominent racial nationalists, envisioned their core
        constituency as a politically mute black population in need of tutelage
        from their ruling-class-backed leaders. Tour&#xE9; F. Reed persuasively
        argues that the mildly updated version of this vision now serves as an
        essential cornerstone of the new black professional-managerial class
        politics. Underclass mythology grounds professional-class claims to race
        leadership, while providing the normative foundation of uplift programs
        directed toward enhancing self-esteem rather than the material
        redistribution of wealth and income.

        Exhortations to celebrate and demand accolades, career opportunities,
        and material accumulation for black celebrities and rich
        people&#x2014;<em>e.g.</em>, box office receipts for black filmmakers or
        contracts and prestigious appointments for other well-positioned black
        people&#x2014;as a racial politics are consistent with the sporadic
        eruptions of &#x201C;Buy Black&#x201D; campaigns since the 1920s and
        1930s. Such efforts stood out in stark contrast to more working-class
        based &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Buy Where You Can&#x2019;t Work&#x201D;
        campaigns that demanded employment opportunities in establishments
        serving black neighborhoods. Like &#x201C;Buy Black&#x201D; campaigns,
        which seem to have risen again from the tomb of petit-bourgeois wishful
        thinking, projections of successes for the rich and famous as generic
        racial victories depend on a sleight-of-hand that treats benefits for
        any black person as benefits for <em>all</em> black people. This brings
        to mind comedian Chris Rock&#x2019;s quip that he went to his mailbox
        every day for two weeks after the not-guilty verdict in the O.&#xA0;J.
        Simpson murder trial looking for his &#x201C;O.&#xA0;J. prize,&#x201D;
        only to be disappointed.

      <h2>Pain and Proprietorship</h2>
      <p>
        At times, this tendency to absorb the plural into the singular can be
        strikingly crude and transparently self-interested. The torrent of
        hostility directed at Rachel Dolezal for having represented herself as
        black rested on groundless&#x2014;sometimes entirely made
        up&#x2014;claims that she had appropriated jobs, awards, and other
        honorifics intended for blacks. In addition to the annual contretemps
        over whether blacks win enough of the most prestigious Oscars, recent
        racial controversies in the art world illustrate how easily the
        narrowest guild concerns can masquerade as burning matters of racial
        justice. The Brooklyn Museum&#x2019;s hiring of a white person as
        consulting curator of African art sparked objections that the hire
        perpetuated &#x201C;pervasive structures of white supremacy in the art
        field.&#x201D; The 2017 furor over the Whitney Biennial&#x2019;s display
        of Dana Schutz&#x2019;s &#x201C;Open Casket&#x201D;&#x2014;inspired by
        the infamous 1955 photograph of Emmett Till&#x2019;s brutalized
        body&#x2014;reduced to a question of ownership of &#x201C;black
        suffering,&#x201D; or more accurately, of the right to represent and
        materially benefit from the representation of black suffering. The
        protesters&#x2019; objection, as Walter Benn Michaels put it succinctly,
        was that &#x201C;black pain belongs to black artists.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#x2019;s worth noting that one of the leading critics of the painting
        and its display was Hannah Black, who contended that &#x201C;non-black
        people must accept that they will never embody and cannot
        understand&#x201D; the gesture Till&#x2019;s mother, Mamie, made in
        insisting on an open-casket funeral. Black, who not only called for the
        painting to be removed from display, but also offered an &#x201C;urgent
        recommendation&#x201D; that it be destroyed, is a Briton who lives in
        Berlin. From a different standard of cultural proprietorship, one might
        argue that Schutz, as an American, has a stronger claim than Black to
        interpret the Till story. After all, the segregationist Southern order
        and the struggle against that order, which gave Till&#x2019;s fate its
        broader social and political significance, were historically specific
        moments of a distinctively American experience. In fact, most claims of
        cultural ownership and charges of appropriation are bogus. While
        sometimes they provide an instrumental basis for tortious claims, as in
        pursuit of restitution for Nazi and other imperialists&#x2019; looting
        of artifacts, more often they posit a dead-end conflation of fixed and
        impermeable racial identity with cultural expression. As Michaels has
        argued for more than twenty-five years, the discourse of cultural
        ownership stems from the pluralist mindset that treats
        &#x201C;culture&#x201D; as a key marker of social groups and thereby
        inscribes it as racial essentialism.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to legitimate what Michaels describes as &#x201C;racial
        rent-seeking,&#x201D; a curiously inflexible brand of race-first
        neoliberalism has taken root in American political discourse, proposing
        a trickle-down model of racial progress, anchored in the mysticism of
        organic black community. Against this exoticized backdrop, neoliberal
        race leaders stage the beguiling fantasy that individual
        &#x201C;entrepreneurialism&#x201D; is the key path to rising above
        one&#x2019;s circumstances&#x2014;<em>i.e.</em>, the standard American
        social myth that obscures the deeper need to combat systemic
        inequalities. The most tragic, and pathetic, expressions of this faith
        are the versions of the &#x201C;gospel of prosperity,&#x201D; which fuse
        pop self-realization psychology and a barely recognizable Christianity
        to exploit desperation and the desire for life with dignity and respect
        among their black-majority congregations. The false hopes of the
        prosperity gospel encourage already vulnerable people to fall prey to
        all sorts of destructive get-rich-quick schemes; they are the
        &#x201C;sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world,
        and the soul of soulless conditions&#x201D; channeled through a
        market-idolatrous Protestant psychobabble. Black ministers and other
        proponents of entrepreneurialist ideology as racial uplift also played a
        largely unrecognized role in pushing subprime mortgages, and even payday
        loans, in black communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The racial trickle-down success myth is partly a vestige of an earlier
        era, during which individual black attainments could be seen as
        testaments to the race&#x2019;s capacities&#x2014;and a refutation of
        the white-sanctioned view of black people as generally inferior. Even
        then, however, this model of black uplift was enmeshed in the race
        theory of the time&#x2014;notably the belief that a race&#x2019;s
        capacities were indicated by the accomplishments of its
        &#x201C;best&#x201D; individuals&#x2014;and it was always inflected with
        the class perspectives of those who saw themselves as such individuals.
        The class legacies of this foundational moment in modern black politics
        may well contribute to the firm insistence among today&#x2019;s
        &#x201C;black voices&#x201D; that slavery and Jim Crow mark the
        transcendent truth of black Americans&#x2019; experience in the United
        States&#x2014;and that an irreducible racism is the source of all
        manifest racial inequality. That diagnosis certainly masks class
        asymmetries among black Americans&#x2019; circumstances as well as in
        the remedies proposed to improve them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, we continue to indulge the politically wrong-headed,
        counterproductive, and even reactionary features of the
        &#x201C;representative black voice&#x201D; industry in whatever remains
        of our contemporary public sphere. And we never reckon with the truly
        disturbing presumption that any black person who can gain access to the
        public microphone and performs familiar rituals of
        &#x201C;blackness&#x201D; should be recognized as expressing significant
        racial truths and deserves our attention. This presumption rests on the
        unexamined premise that blacks share a common, singular mind that is at
        once radically unknowable to non-blacks and readily downloaded by any
        random individual setting up shop as a racial voice. And despite what
        all of our age&#x2019;s many heroic narratives of individualist
        race-first triumph may suggest to the casual viewer,
        <em>that</em> premise is the essence of racism.
