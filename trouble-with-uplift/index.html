      <p>
        Occasionally, on a boring flight, I’ll rewatch the Battle of James
        Island scene from the magnificent 1989 film, <em>Glory</em>. The scene
        depicts the first engagement of the 54<sup>th</sup> Massachusetts
        Infantry, the first Northern regiment of black troops organized by the
        Army of the United States to fight against the Confederate insurrection.
        James Island was a fateful battle outside Charleston, SC, on July 16,
        1863. I pulled up the clip on a recent flight and was moved yet again by
        the powerful imagery of black men finally able to strike a blow against
        the slaveocracy. Imagining what that felt like for the soldiers of the
        54<sup>th</sup> is always intensely gratifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching it this time, I remembered how startled I had been when
        <em>Glory</em> was released to learn that many people, including blacks
        and people on the left, dismissed or even disparaged the film as a
        “white savior narrative”—a phrase that is now a routine derogation of
        certain cross-racial sagas of resistance to white supremacy. In
        <em>Glory</em>’s case, this complaint arose mainly in response to the
        (historically accurate) depiction of the regiment’s commanding officers
        as Northern whites.
      </p>
      <p>
        This objection left me dumbfounded. After all, the 54<sup>th</sup>
        Massachusetts was a real historical entity. As a compromise to ensure
        political support, it was stipulated that its officers be white.
        Nonetheless, prominent abolitionists, including Frederick Douglass and
        the free black community of Boston, were enthusiastic about its
        formation and instrumental in recruiting its ranks.
      </p>
      <h2>The Myth of the Birth of the Hero</h2>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding some artistic license (<em>e.g.</em>, including freed
        slaves within the 54<sup>th</sup>, when it was actually composed
        entirely of free black men), <em>Glory</em>’s director Edward Zwick
        clearly intended it to be an historical film. How could it not feature
        white officers?
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, the indictment of <em>Glory</em> as white-savior
        propaganda was common on the left—with the allied claim that the story
        was told largely through the eyes of the regiment’s young commander,
        Col. Robert Gould Shaw, who was killed leading the 54<sup>th</sup>’s
        attack on the Confederate South Carolina stronghold, Ft. Wagner. Leaving
        aside the fact that more black characters than white ones have
        autonomous voices and personalities, the film was largely based on
        Shaw’s moving letters home, which were compiled in the volume
        <em>Blue-Eyed Child of Fortune</em>. All such judgments are
        idiosyncratic, to be sure, but I was left scratching my head at the
        ideologically charged reaction to what may be the greatest American film
        ever made—certainly greater than two others that have been so judged:
        <em>The Birth of a Nation</em>, D. W. Griffith’s 1915 paean to white
        supremacy and the Ku Klux Klan, and its update for the talkie era,
        <em>Gone with the Wind</em>. I could not understand at the time how
        <em>Glory</em>’s critics seemed to miss or make light of such a powerful
        depiction of popular black political agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I think I understand. I’ve long suspected that, to a certain strain
        of race-conscious or antiracist discourse, historical exploration in
        popular culture was less important than the propagation of tales of
        inspiration and uplift. These fables typically feature singular black
        heroes who have overcome crushing racist adversity against all odds. In
        recent years, a steady stream of films and other narratives have openly
        embraced that preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have written elsewhere about several of them. Producer George Lucas
        touted his execrable, cartoonish depiction of World War II’s Tuskegee
        Airmen, <em>Red Tails</em> (2012), as a work spotlighting “real heroes”
        who would be “inspirational for teenage boys” and compared it favorably
        to “<em>Glory</em>, where you have a lot of white officers running those
        guys into cannon fodder.” And Quentin Tarantino’s 2012 race film
        <em>Django Unchained</em> reduced slavery and manumission to the antics
        of a spaghetti-Western-style hero who in fact never challenges slavery
        but fixates only on rescuing his wife. Ava DuVernay acknowledged that
        she intentionally falsified the history of the iconic voting-rights
        campaign in her 2014 film <em>Selma</em> to deny President Lyndon
        Johnson’s role because she “wasn’t interested in making a white-savior
        movie.” As a consequence, she also misrepresented the tensions between
        Martin Luther King, Jr. and his Southern Christian Leadership Conference
        (SCLC) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC)
        activists in the campaign—which had precisely to do with King’s
        surreptitious negotiations with Johnson. The effect of omitting such a
        central tactical debate was to depict the civil rights struggle as a
        simple extrusion of King’s larger-than-life persona against a pandemic
        racism—as a struggle, in other words, with virtually no politics to
        speak of.
      </p>
      <h2>Nation-Building</h2>
      <p>
        Nate Parker’s 2016 dramatization of the 1831 Virginia slave rebellion
        led by Nat Turner, <em>The Birth of a Nation</em> (which quite
        intentionally sets itself up as an answer to Griffith’s film from a
        century earlier), is an even more strident display of the inclination to
        subordinate the complexities of actual history to a narrative of black
        heroism in the face of universal and unremitting white supremacy and
        racism. As Kenneth W. Warren argues in the
        <em>Los Angeles Review of Books</em>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          For Parker … the point of history is not so much to figure out what
          really happened but rather to enable reparative and redemptive
          mythmaking… A further entailment of Parker’s view of his achievement
          is that history, for him, must remain narrow—a conduit for inspiration
          or therapy, for bequeathing legacies, or for purveying information or
          misinformation to the present—and not much more. Parker’s
          understanding of what makes Turner heroic is that he resisted his
          oppression and that his act of resistance can serve as a model for the
          rest of us.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Warren readily concedes that Parker, though clearly knowing of them, had
        no obligation to broaden his narrative to include such entailments.
        Still, it’s far from inconsequential to note the political legacy of
        Turner’s 1831 uprising; in the state that would later serve as the
        capital of the Confederacy, whites launched a searching debate over the
        possibility of manumission. Warren quotes Stephen Oates’s
        <em>The Fires of Jubilee: Nat Turner’s Fierce Rebellion</em> (1975),
        which notes that “in the western part of the state, where antislavery
        and anti-Negro sentiment had long been stirring, whites held public
        rallies in which they openly endorsed emancipation—yes, the liberation
        of all of Virginia’s 470,000 slaves—as the only safeguard in these
        dangerous times.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, those discussions did not succeed in ending slavery in
        Virginia. However, as Warren notes, “they point to a truth rarely
        narrated about the South, namely, that it has never been as solidly
        pro-slavery or even as anti-black as popular imagination has depicted
        it”; he goes on to cite as a crucial case in point the rise of the
        interracial Readjuster Party, which wrested electoral power from planter
        elites and governed Virginia from 1879 to 1883—nearly two decades after
        the antislavery western counties seceded to form West Virginia.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I’m not suggesting that Parker should be held responsible for
        incorporating these events into his story—there’s nothing wrong with
        keeping his lens trained on the Turner rebellion,” Warren writes. “But I
        am saying there’s no evidence that, in trying to think about what
        confronting the past might do for us, Parker ever looked beyond the
        obvious, both in terms of the story he told and the narrative techniques
        he employed to tell us.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The film’s concluding scene drives home this point in unmistakable
        terms, dissolving away from a weeping black boy observing Turner’s
        execution into the Union soldier he will become, as if inspired directly
        by Turner’s sacrifice—sidestepping virtually all the actual history that
        <em>Glory</em> tries to reckon with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warren also contrasts Parker’s vision to the one that animates Gary
        Ross’s underappreciated 2016 film, <em>Free State of Jones</em>, which
        was also widely dismissed on its release as just another white-savior
        narrative. The film’s narrative indeed centered on the character of
        Newton Knight, a white Mississippi farmer and Confederate deserter who,
        as Warren notes, “leads an interracial insurgency of runaway slaves and
        yeoman farmers against the Confederacy and its planter elites in
        southeastern Mississippi, where for a brief shining moment they
        establish the Free State of Jones.” Ross traces the surprisingly robust
        efforts of the Knight insurgency to institutionalize a new, egalitarian
        regime, and proceeds to chronicle its defeat during the period of
        Presidential Reconstruction, which restored the Mississippi planter
        class into power.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, just as with the early dismissals of <em>Glory</em>, the
        caricatures of <em>Free State of Jones</em> as a one-note study in white
        saviorship bears no resemblance to the film in question and its
        historically nuanced narrative. For example,
        <em>Free State</em> includes perhaps the only filmic representation ever
        of freedpeople’s self-organization via the Union League—a key chapter in
        early Southern postbellum efforts to create an anti-planter coalition of
        biracial workers’ parties that the chorus of kneejerk “white savior”
        dismissals tellingly overlooks. Knight and the members of his insurgency
        were actual historical figures, and Ross’s narrative is generally
        faithful to the actual history in which they were embedded and which
        they made. So, as in <em>Glory</em>, the only way to narrate the story
        without Knight as the central dramatis persona would be to abandon
        historical accuracy; doing so would require a fantasy more on the order
        of <em>Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</em>, perhaps replacing Lincoln
        with Frederick Douglass for good measure. (The “white savior” dismissal
        actually may have reached its apotheosis in the preposterous assertion
        that neither Lincoln, the Union army, nor Congress ended slavery but,
        rather, the slaves somehow “freed themselves”—to cite a frequent
        criticism of another film widely dismissed on white saviorship grounds,
        Steven Spielberg’s 2012 biopic <em>Lincoln</em>. The political
        sensibility underlying such an assertion betrays a hostility to
        institutional politics and the role of government that one would expect
        to find deep inside a survivalist bunker.)
      </p>
      <h2>Waiting for Superman</h2>
      <p>
        This year’s blockbuster, Ryan Coogler’s <em>Black Panther</em>, takes
        the further step of jettisoning history altogether and rendering the
        narrative of black heroism—in fact Superheroism—in the realm of pure
        fantasy. Coogler intends the mythical African nation of Wakanda to be
        black Americans’ “fairy tale version of Africa,” as he told an
        interviewer for <em>Rolling Stone</em>. “We were kings and queens, and
        we walked around and ate perfect food, and everyone was free.”
        Revealingly, the Superhero from which the film (like the comic book from
        which it is derived) draws its name is a king, and the conflict with his
        supervillain antagonist is rooted in a struggle over monarchical
        succession. Everyone was only as free as the king would permit them to
        be, in other words.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whatever Coogler’s auteurish intentions to render
        <em>Black Panther</em> a fable of American black empowerment, its
        release triggered an all-too-familiar torrent of hype that alchemizes
        the collective struggle for racial justice into still one more praise
        song hymning a hyperindividualist hero Challenging Stultifyingly Generic
        White Oppression and Overcoming It Against All Odds. Literature
        professor Salamishah Tillet, writing in the <em>New York Times</em> on
        the film’s release, approvingly quotes Jonathan Gray’s summary of the
        film’s fan-boy appeal:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Now there you have every black boy’s fantasy. He is richer than Bill
          Gates, smarter than Elon Musk, better looking than Denzel… He is the
          hereditary ruler of the richest nation on Earth. The movie is about
          wish fulfillment. When you see Bruce Wayne, this dashing billionaire,
          where is the black version of that? You got T’Challa.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        On the breathless extreme of the spectrum, commercial imperative and
        outsized political claims fuse into an indistinguishable unity; phony
        liberationist calls to respond to obvious marketing and merchandising
        tie-in ploys—<em>e.g.</em>, guides for identifying and purchasing
        replicas of “African” artifacts and styles displayed in T’Challa’s
        kingdom and guides for “mapping Wakanda”—urge participation in the
        commercial hype machine as though it were a form of political
        engagement. Amid this marketing land rush, the irony scarcely registers
        that the separatist monarchy of Wakanda was invented by two white men,
        Stan Lee and Jack Kirbye—a considerable challenge to the race-first
        rhetoric of white-savior spotters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, <em>Black Panther</em> did not invent this conflation of
        Hollywood consumerism with racial uplift; it’s merely cashed in on it.
        This cynical maneuver has figured prominently in the promotion of a host
        of politically reactionary films like
        <em>Waiting for “Superman”</em> (2010), <em>Won’t Back Down</em> (2012),
        and <em>Beasts of the Southern Wild</em> (2012), each of which sold
        seeing the film and talking it up to one’s friends as something akin to
        political movement-building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parker’s and Coogler’s films are innovative in one sense, however; they
        each foreground the specific ideological program that arises out of the
        anti-historical celebration of individual black heroism. To be sure,
        their appeal conforms to a general formula of escapist entertainment
        that’s by no means limited to black cultural expression—the Hero
        Overcoming Against All Odds. And many black people, both autonomously
        and with the prod of cultural cues, no doubt derive a particular
        satisfaction from racial identification with themes and
        characters—however fleeting such pleasure may be in the frenzied
        marketing of images and brands in the American omni-entertainment state.
      </p>
      <p>
        What sets the contemporary genre of inspirational black hero films apart
        is the way the fantasies they enact connect with the race-first
        sensibilities prominent among black and other professional-managerial
        strata. These race commentators share a body of ideological assumptions
        and material interests, deeply invested in parsing, interpreting, and
        administering inequality in terms of racial disparities. Specifically,
        this genre of critique typically looks to measure and remediate the
        exclusion of black professionals from traditionally white power elites.
        Identifying the tacit social agenda embedded in the “white savior
        narrative” charge brings us to the heart of the matter.
      </p>
      <h2>The New Hollywood Shuffle</h2>
      <p>
        Dismissals of <em>Glory</em> and <em>Free State of Jones</em>, as well
        as DuVernay’s explanation for the historical falsifications at play in
        <em>Selma</em>, may give the impression that the detractors of white
        saviorship are voicing a populist sensibility, complaining that black
        people are represented as incapable of effective social action without a
        white person (usually a man) leading them. And there is ample precedent
        in the history of popular culture for suspicion in that regard. The
        Tarzan films are perhaps the crassest and best-known examples; my father
        often remarked sarcastically that Africans should be grateful for
        Tarzan’s presence, since otherwise they apparently would all have been
        eaten by lions and crocodiles. The 1988 film
        <em>Mississippi Burning</em> incongruously makes FBI agents (white,
        though does that really matter?) the heroes of the civil rights
        campaign. Richard Attenborough’s 1987 <em>Cry Freedom</em> describes the
        struggle against apartheid and the murder of Stephen Biko through the
        travails of his white friend, the journalist Donald Woods. And there are
        many more examples; it is in fact the long history of such narratives
        that makes what might otherwise be simple feel-good stories, presented
        with an interracial twist—<em>Conrack</em> (1974),
        <em>Dangerous Minds</em> (1995), and <em>The Blind Side</em> (2009),
        among many others—something more distasteful and pernicious than just a
        set of interchangeable thematic variations on the maudlin human-interest
        narrative of uplift and overcoming.
      </p>
      <p>
        But “white savior” objections to <em>Glory</em> and
        <em>Free State</em> are a different matter. Those films hinge largely on
        the prominence of black agency, which race-first critics apparently deem
        irrelevant. Their objection is not that blacks’ agency is absent; it is
        rather about who is represented as leading their efforts. Decisions by
        blacks to support nonblack candidates or social policies not expressed
        in race-first terms are interpreted as evidence of flawed, limited,
        misguided, or otherwise co-opted black agency. The idea that blacks,
        like everyone else, make their history under conditions not of their own
        choosing becomes irrelevant, just another instance of insufficient
        symbolic representation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The notion that black Americans are political agents just like other
        Americans, and can forge their own tactical alliances and coalitions to
        advance their interests in a pluralist political order, is ruled out
        here on principle. Instead, blacks are imagined as so abject that only
        extraordinary intervention by committed black leaders has a prayer of
        producing real change. This pernicious assumption continually
        subordinates actually existing history to imaginary cultural narratives
        of individual black heroism and helps drive the intense—and
        myopic—opposition that many antiracist activists and commentators
        express to Bernie Sanders, social democracy, and a politics centered on
        economic inequality and working-class concerns.
      </p>
      <h2>Class Is Dismissed</h2>
      <p>
        The striking hostility to such a politics within the higher reaches of
        antiracist activism illustrates the extent to which what bills itself as
        black politics today is in fact a class politics: it is not interested
        in the concerns of working people of whatever race or gender. Indeed, a
        spate of recent media reports have retailed evidence that upper-class
        black Americans may be experiencing stagnant-to-declining social
        mobility—which is taken as prima facie evidence of the stubbornly racist
        cast of the American social order:
        <em>Even rich professionals like us</em>, elite commentators suggest,
        <em>are denied the right to secure our own class standing</em>. It is
        also telling that the study that provoked the media reports—Raj Chetty,
        <em>et al</em>., “Race and Economic Opportunity in the United States: An
        Intergenerational Perspective”—rehearses the hoary recommendation that
        “reducing the intergenerational persistence of the black-white income
        gap will require policies whose impacts cross neighborhood and class
        lines and increase upward mobility specifically for black men.” These
        include “mentoring programs for black boys, efforts to reduce racial
        bias among whites, or efforts to facilitate social interaction across
        racial groups within a given area.” That’s pretty thin gruel, warmed
        over bromides and all too familiar paternalism and no actually
        redistributive policies at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context the pronounced animus trained on the figure of the
        “white savior” emerges as litmus test for the critical role of racial
        gatekeeper in respectable political discourse. The gatekeeping question
        has, for more than a century, focused on who speaks for black Americans
        and determines the “black agenda.” And the status of black leader,
        spokesperson, or “voice” has always been a direct function of contested
        class prerogative, dating back a century and more to Booker T.
        Washington, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, and Anna Julia Cooper.
        Specifically, the gatekeeping function is the obsession of the
        professional-managerial strata who pursue what Warren has described as
        “managerial authority over the nation’s Negro problem.” How do “black
        leaders” become recognized? The answer is the same now as for Washington
        in the 1890s; recognition as a legitimate black leader, or “voice,”
        requires ratification by elite opinion-shaping institutions and
        individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gatekeeping hasn’t been the exclusive preoccupation of Bookerite
        conservatives or liberals like Du Bois. Even militant black nationalists
        and racial separatists like Marcus Garvey and the leaders of the Nation
        of Islam have pursued validation as black leaders from dominant white
        elites to support programs of racial “self-help” or uplift. From Black
        Power to Black Lives Matter, claimants to speak on behalf of the race
        have courted recognition from the Ford Foundation and other
        white-dominated nonprofit philanthropies and NGOs. And the emergence of
        cable news networks and the blogosphere have exponentially expanded the
        number and types of entities that can anoint race leaders and
        representative voices.
      </p>
      <p>
        This new welter of platforms and voices seeking to promulgate and
        validate the acceptable terms of black leadership has made the category
        seem all the more beyond question, as black racial voices pop up all
        over the place all the time. So, for example, the self-proclaimed black
        voice Tia Oso was brought front and center in the 2015 Netroots
        Presidential Town Hall featuring Martin O’Malley and Bernie Sanders,
        where she proclaimed that “black leadership must be foregrounded and
        central to progressive strategies.” Likewise, the presumed moral
        authority of race leadership enabled Marissa Johnson and Mara Jacqueline
        Willaford to prevent Sanders from speaking at a Social Security rally in
        Seattle—as though the long-term viability of Social Security were not a
        black issue. The instant recourse to a posture of leadership is how
        random Black Lives Matter activists and a vast corps of pundits and
        bloggers are able to issue <em>ex cathedra</em> declarations about which
        issues are and are not pertinent to black Americans.
      </p>
      <h2>Voices in a Political Vacuum</h2>
      <p>
        The freelance black leader—and its more recent, superficially more
        pluralist incarnation, the black “voice”—is a legacy harking back to the
        era of massive black disfranchisement at the end of the nineteenth
        century. It also has drawn considerable staying power from the amorphous
        concept of “race relations,” according to which, in the judgment of
        historian Michael R. West in his 2006 study
        <em>The Education of Booker T. Washington</em>, “blacks and whites—or
        ‘black America’ and ‘white America’—are basic, indivisible units of
        political interest… The race relations framework appealed to white
        elites because it sidestepped the troublesome fact of blacks’
        constitutional claims to full and equal citizenship by proposing a focus
        on the evanescent issue of how the ‘races’ relate as an alternative to
        matters like denial of rights and equal protection under the law.” West
        also notes that “interests and aspirations of politicians and ministers,
        workers and businessmen, parents and teachers would no longer be
        expressed by way of the normal, if potentially messy, institutional
        channels through which Americans settled their conflicts and
        competition. Instead, they would be mediated through the good offices of
        ‘Negro leaders,’ ever mindful of where their mandate comes from and the
        requirement placed on them as a first principle ‘to cement the
        friendship of the two races.’ ” The warrant to cement the friendship of
        the races, of course, meant framing racial comity on terms acceptable to
        the dominant white elites who ratified claims to black leadership and
        decided which of those claims were “responsible” or “right-thinking.”
      </p>
      <p>
        The race-relations mindset also shaped the ideological outlook of racial
        advocacy and uplift groups like the National Urban League and the
        National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Both groups,
        for example, were hesitant to support labor organization for black
        workers during the Great Depression since they relied on donations from
        liberal funders steeped in anti-union sentiments; also, apostles of
        racial uplift tended to come from a professional-managerial background
        themselves, again highlighting the extent to which there has always been
        a class dimension to black politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this is to suggest that claimants to race leadership even in the
        Bookerite era were dupes or supplicants who were not sincerely committed
        “race men” and “race women” in the parlance of the time. Rather, as
        Warren, West, and others have argued, the stratum of the black
        population that tended to incubate aspiring race leaders also cohered
        around views of proper racial agendas—what the “race” needed and how its
        position in the world could be advanced, <em>i.e.</em>, what constituted
        “uplift”—that also reflected the priorities of philanthropic elites.
        These mutually dependent groups were likely to share a baseline sense of
        how American society should be structured—and specifically of how to
        manage existing class hierarchies so as to better navigate blacks’ place
        within them. That said, most racial advocates were doubtless more
        committed than their patrons to the pursuit of full equality of
        opportunity.
      </p>
      <h2>The Revolution Will Be Televised</h2>
      <p>
        The terms of this tacit social contract shifted with the victories of
        the civil rights movement and the cultural insurgencies of the 1960s and
        1970s; suddenly, raw racial subordination no longer commanded uncritical
        assent from the liberal wing of the American power elite. At the same
        time, though, this civil rights revolution and its aftermath worked to
        obscure the striking continuity in the underlying socioeconomic dynamics
        that continue to validate race leaders, spokespersons, or representative
        voices. The open—or at least public—performance of supplication before
        powerful elites is no longer necessary or desirable for validation.
        Indeed, Black Power “militancy” and various cultural-separatist projects
        aligned with black nationalism supported new claimants’ discourse of
        authenticity—one that gained wider credence via assertive demands for
        equal power instead of humble requests for recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the surface, at least, it now appeared that the essentially dependent
        relation between white liberal arbiters or power and their black
        counterparts had morphed into something more radical. And this new
        assertive liturgy of dependence works to the benefit of both grantors
        and grantees of political legitimacy and economic largess—players who
        all shared a stake in projecting an appearance of the anointed’s racial
        authenticity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, this liturgy is everywhere on display—along with the same power
        dynamics that sustain it. In academic institutions and programs, op-ed
        pages, magazines and blogs, and of course cable television newschat
        programs, we see a steady stream of racial voices and leaders plotting
        out the permissible boundaries of black authenticity and black
        leadership values. This surface accord within the charmed circle of
        <em>soi-disant</em> black leaders reinforces the illusion, just as was
        the case in the aftermath of the civil rights era, that they have all
        emerged from the grassroots.
      </p>
      <p>
        The increasing significance of the corporate newsfotainment industry
        means that things could scarcely seem otherwise to most casual viewers
        and audiences. The leading platforms of respectable black
        discourse—including the various internet platforms that encourage
        freelance chatter—reinforce the sense that those purporting to express
        the black point of view arise naturally from within the quasi-mythic
        “black community.” But of course the immediacy of all these venues,
        despite their many claims to have vanquished old-guard “gatekeepers” and
        “legacy media” forums, has rendered the selection processes behind the
        elevation of this or that leadership “voice” almost completely opaque.
        Not all points of view can gain a hearing, after all. Terms like
        “responsible” and “right-thinking” seldom slip into public discussion
        anymore because they evoke explicit subordination; nevertheless,
        sporadic calls for recognized black voices to distance themselves from
        “extremist” or otherwise unacceptable views expressed by other black
        “voices”—most recently via another predictably vile anti-Semitic
        utterance from Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan—reveal that such
        criteria are critical in setting the boundaries of public legitimacy for
        aspiring black leaders. Another telling instance of the same dynamic
        ocurred when Keith Ellison, the African American Muslim congressman from
        Minnesota, sought to chair the Democratic National Committee as a
        Sanders supporter; here again, the sensible centrist consensus
        counteroffensive depicted Ellison as simply too fringe and divisive a
        figure to command authority in the sacred political mainstream.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside the close vetting of respectable black voices in the media
        mainstream there’s been a prolonged atrophy of popular political
        mobilization behind issues of economic equity for black Americans. Taken
        together, these trends have opened a shortcut path to broader public
        recognition for self-styled race leaders. For more than a decade, it has
        been common to encounter young people who enter graduate programs in
        order to prepare for careers as racial voices or “public intellectuals,”
        hoping to obtain a credential that can procure valuable space on the
        <em>Huffington Post</em>, the <em>Root</em>, or MSNBC. In the quest for
        mediagenic legitimacy, some eager race pundits have launched
        organizations that are barely more than letterhead or résumé entries;
        these feints are likewise often accompanied by Potemkin-style protest
        activism, including many of the donor-driven groups aligned with Black
        Lives Matter, or glorified photo-ops intended to evoke mass agitation.
        Among this cohort of racial voices, the essential qualification for
        recognition seems to be inclination to declaim on the intractability of
        an undifferentiated, ahistorical racism as a fetter on all black
        Americans’ life chances across the sweep of the nation’s history. As a
        corollary, they’re required to insist that objection to generic racial
        disparities constitutes the totality of black political concerns.
      </p>
      <h2>Reduced and Abandoned</h2>
      <p>
        The politics thus advanced is profoundly race-reductionist, discounting
        the value of both political agency and the broad pursuit of political
        alliances within a polity held to be intractably and irredeemably
        devoted to white supremacy. This fatalistic outlook works seamlessly to
        reinforce the status of racial voices who emphasize the interests and
        concerns of a singular racial collectivity. Central to these pundits’
        message is the assertion that blacks have it worse, in every
        socio-cultural context that might be adduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        This refrain is also consistent in two important ways with the reigning
        ideology of neoliberal equality. First, the insistence that disparities
        of racial access to power are the most meaningful forms of inequality
        strongly reinforces the neoliberal view that inequalities generated by
        capitalist market forces are natural and lie beyond the scope of
        intervention. And second, if American racism is an intractable,
        transhistorical force—indeed, an ontological one, as Ta-Nehisi Coates
        has characterized it—then it lies beyond structural political
        intervention. In other words, Coates and other race-firsters diminish
        the significance of the legislative and other institutional victories
        won since Emancipation, leaving us with only exhortations to individual
        conversion and repentance as a program.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why, for example, Coates and other proponents of reparations
        seem unconcerned with the strategic problem of piecing together the kind
        of interracial popular support necessary to actually prevail on the
        issue. Such problems do not exist for them because the role of the
        representative black leader or voice is precisely to function as an
        <em>alternative</em> to political action. Instead, the order of the day
        is typically to perform racial authenticity in a way that doubles as an
        appeal for moral recognition from those with the power to bestow it.
        Winning anything politically—policies or changes in power relations—is
        not the point. That is why the jeremiads offered by contemporary racial
        voices so commonly boil down to calls for “conversations about race” or
        equally vapid abstractions like “racial reckoning” or “coming to terms
        with” a history defined by racism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The black leadership role was always at best an accommodation to
        disfranchisement, going back to its first modern incarnation with Booker
        T. Washington and his cohort of racial advocates. It is a politics of
        elite transaction. That is not in itself necessarily a bad
        thing—President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “black cabinet,” or Federal
        Council of Negro Affairs, advised him on matters related to black
        Americans. But unlike today’s freelance racial voices, they were
        administration functionaries, and most had standing in racial advocacy,
        education, labor, and government institutions prior to joining the
        “cabinet.” The backdoor dealings between King and Johnson during the
        Selma campaign that DuVernay found too messy to include in her portrait
        of King’s heroic persona were also part of mundane political
        maneuvering, the inside-outside game of institutional politics. King and
        the SCLC, like FDR’s black cabinet, had constituencies that underwrote
        their standing as representatives of racial interest—which in turn gave
        them leverage to make political demands and pursue policy agendas. A.
        Philip Randolph used the March on Washington Movement to pressure
        President Roosevelt in 1941 to issue “Executive Order 8802,” prohibiting
        racial discrimination in the national defense industry. Randolph, Bayard
        Rustin, the Negro American Labor Council, and others organized the 1963
        March on Washington as part of an inside-outside strategy to build
        support for a jobs program and passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this painstaking political effort could not be farther from the
        careerist pursuits of contemporary racial voices, whose standing depends
        entirely on the favor of powerful opinion-shaping elites in corporate
        media and elsewhere. Thus, for example, Touré Neblett and others in
        MSNBC’s stable were unceremoniously expunged from the lineup of talking
        heads when the network reconfigured its marketing priorities. More
        dramatically, Melissa Harris-Perry, apparently believing that her
        viewing audience gave her leverage, openly rebuffed the network’s demand
        to reorient her program to fit in with its election coverage. In short
        order, she and her program vanished without a trace from its schedule.
        Such incidents, and scores of others like them, make it indelibly clear
        where the lines of authority run when it comes to winning elite-media
        recognition as a black voice.
      </p>
      <h2>For Their Own Good</h2>
      <p>
        The race voices I’ve discussed express a particular class perspective
        among black Americans, one that harmonizes with left-neoliberal notions
        of justice and equality. That harmony may help explain why those racial
        voices—like the black political class in general—are so intent on
        disparaging the social-democratic politics associated with Bernie
        Sanders, even though a 2017 Harvard-Harris survey found that Sanders was
        far more popular with African Americans than with any other demographic
        category except declared Democrats. He boasted a 73 percent favorable
        rating among black voters—higher than his approval numbers among
        Hispanics, Asian-Americans, and considerably higher than those for
        whites or even 18–34 year-olds.
      </p>
      <p>
        This disjunction between popular opinion and the priorities of the black
        chattering class underscores the extent to which the racial programs and
        priorities advanced by those recognized black voices remain much as they
        were in the Age of Washington. Now as then, we have a leadership stratum
        dedicated to the class-skewed pursuit of “managerial authority over the
        nation’s Negro problem.” And the net effect of this top-down model of
        black discourse is to tether a politics of racial representation to the
        ruling-class agendas that generate and intensify inequality and
        insecurity for working people across American society, including among
        the ranks of black Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black Clintonites, like Congressmen John Lewis (D-GA), James Clyburn
        (D-SC) and Cedric Richmond (D-LA), all clearly displayed this commitment
        during the 2016 Democratic primaries when they attacked Sanders as
        “irresponsible” in calling for non-commodified public goods in
        education, health care, and other areas. Richmond’s rebuke was
        especially telling in that he couched it in terms of his role as chair
        of the Congressional Black Caucus and the group’s “responsibility to
        make sure to know that young people know that” a social-democratic
        agenda is “too good to be true.” Richmond’s invocation of civic
        instruction for the young may be revealing in another way. Lurking
        beneath that piety is the deeply sedimented common sense of underclass
        ideology, which posits a population mired in pathologies and hemmed in
        by an overwhelming racism, and the corollary of interventions aiming to
        enhance capabilities for individual mobility. (It is, indeed, this same
        tacit rhetoric of permanent crisis that fuels the notion that black
        young people must be raised on a diet of inspirational movies.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This vision of unyielding black pathology is yet another testament to
        the harmony of antiracist and neoliberal ideologies—and it, too, harks
        directly back to the origins of the black leadership caste at the dawn
        of the last century. Washington and Du Bois, together with Garvey and
        other prominent racial nationalists, envisioned their core constituency
        as a politically mute black population in need of tutelage from their
        ruling-class-backed leaders. Touré F. Reed persuasively argues that the
        mildly updated version of this vision now serves as an essential
        cornerstone of the new black professional-managerial class politics.
        Underclass mythology grounds professional-class claims to race
        leadership, while providing the normative foundation of uplift programs
        directed toward enhancing self-esteem rather than the material
        redistribution of wealth and income.
      </p>
      <p>
        Exhortations to celebrate and demand accolades, career opportunities,
        and material accumulation for black celebrities and rich
        people—<em>e.g.</em>, box office receipts for black filmmakers or
        contracts and prestigious appointments for other well-positioned black
        people—as a racial politics are consistent with the sporadic eruptions
        of “Buy Black” campaigns since the 1920s and 1930s. Such efforts stood
        out in stark contrast to more working-class based “Don’t Buy Where You
        Can’t Work” campaigns that demanded employment opportunities in
        establishments serving black neighborhoods. Like “Buy Black” campaigns,
        which seem to have risen again from the tomb of petit-bourgeois wishful
        thinking, projections of successes for the rich and famous as generic
        racial victories depend on a sleight-of-hand that treats benefits for
        any black person as benefits for <em>all</em> black people. This brings
        to mind comedian Chris Rock’s quip that he went to his mailbox every day
        for two weeks after the not-guilty verdict in the O. J. Simpson murder
        trial looking for his “O. J. prize,” only to be disappointed.
      </p>
      <h2>Pain and Proprietorship</h2>
      <p>
        At times, this tendency to absorb the plural into the singular can be
        strikingly crude and transparently self-interested. The torrent of
        hostility directed at Rachel Dolezal for having represented herself as
        black rested on groundless—sometimes entirely made up—claims that she
        had appropriated jobs, awards, and other honorifics intended for blacks.
        In addition to the annual contretemps over whether blacks win enough of
        the most prestigious Oscars, recent racial controversies in the art
        world illustrate how easily the narrowest guild concerns can masquerade
        as burning matters of racial justice. The Brooklyn Museum’s hiring of a
        white person as consulting curator of African art sparked objections
        that the hire perpetuated “pervasive structures of white supremacy in
        the art field.” The 2017 furor over the Whitney Biennial’s display of
        Dana Schutz’s “Open Casket”—inspired by the infamous 1955 photograph of
        Emmett Till’s brutalized body—reduced to a question of ownership of
        “black suffering,” or more accurately, of the right to represent and
        materially benefit from the representation of black suffering. The
        protesters’ objection, as Walter Benn Michaels put it succinctly, was
        that “black pain belongs to black artists.”
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s worth noting that one of the leading critics of the painting and
        its display was Hannah Black, who contended that “non-black people must
        accept that they will never embody and cannot understand” the gesture
        Till’s mother, Mamie, made in insisting on an open-casket funeral.
        Black, who not only called for the painting to be removed from display,
        but also offered an “urgent recommendation” that it be destroyed, is a
        Briton who lives in Berlin. From a different standard of cultural
        proprietorship, one might argue that Schutz, as an American, has a
        stronger claim than Black to interpret the Till story. After all, the
        segregationist Southern order and the struggle against that order, which
        gave Till’s fate its broader social and political significance, were
        historically specific moments of a distinctively American experience. In
        fact, most claims of cultural ownership and charges of appropriation are
        bogus. While sometimes they provide an instrumental basis for tortious
        claims, as in pursuit of restitution for Nazi and other imperialists’
        looting of artifacts, more often they posit a dead-end conflation of
        fixed and impermeable racial identity with cultural expression. As
        Michaels has argued for more than twenty-five years, the discourse of
        cultural ownership stems from the pluralist mindset that treats
        “culture” as a key marker of social groups and thereby inscribes it as
        racial essentialism.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to legitimate what Michaels describes as “racial rent-seeking,”
        a curiously inflexible brand of race-first neoliberalism has taken root
        in American political discourse, proposing a trickle-down model of
        racial progress, anchored in the mysticism of organic black community.
        Against this exoticized backdrop, neoliberal race leaders stage the
        beguiling fantasy that individual “entrepreneurialism” is the key path
        to rising above one’s circumstances—<em>i.e.</em>, the standard American
        social myth that obscures the deeper need to combat systemic
        inequalities. The most tragic, and pathetic, expressions of this faith
        are the versions of the “gospel of prosperity,” which fuse pop
        self-realization psychology and a barely recognizable Christianity to
        exploit desperation and the desire for life with dignity and respect
        among their black-majority congregations. The false hopes of the
        prosperity gospel encourage already vulnerable people to fall prey to
        all sorts of destructive get-rich-quick schemes; they are the “sigh of
        the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of
        soulless conditions” channeled through a market-idolatrous Protestant
        psychobabble. Black ministers and other proponents of entrepreneurialist
        ideology as racial uplift also played a largely unrecognized role in
        pushing subprime mortgages, and even payday loans, in black communities.

        The racial trickle-down success myth is partly a vestige of an earlier
        era, during which individual black attainments could be seen as
        testaments to the race’s capacities—and a refutation of the
        white-sanctioned view of black people as generally inferior. Even then,
        however, this model of black uplift was enmeshed in the race theory of
        the time—notably the belief that a race’s capacities were indicated by
        the accomplishments of its “best” individuals—and it was always
        inflected with the class perspectives of those who saw themselves as
        such individuals. The class legacies of this foundational moment in
        modern black politics may well contribute to the firm insistence among
        today’s “black voices” that slavery and Jim Crow mark the transcendent
        truth of black Americans’ experience in the United States—and that an
        irreducible racism is the source of all manifest racial inequality. That
        diagnosis certainly masks class asymmetries among black Americans’
        circumstances as well as in the remedies proposed to improve them.

        Nevertheless, we continue to indulge the politically wrong-headed,
        counterproductive, and even reactionary features of the “representative
        black voice” industry in whatever remains of our contemporary public
        sphere. And we never reckon with the truly disturbing presumption that
        any black person who can gain access to the public microphone and
        performs familiar rituals of “blackness” should be recognized as
        expressing significant racial truths and deserves our attention. This
        presumption rests on the unexamined premise that blacks share a common,
        singular mind that is at once radically unknowable to non-blacks and
        readily downloaded by any random individual setting up shop as a racial
        voice. And despite what all of our age’s many heroic narratives of
        individualist race-first triumph may suggest to the casual viewer,
        <em>that</em> premise is the essence of racism.
