          >Do America&#x2019;s Socialists Have a Race Problem?</a
        >&#x201D; (<em>The New Republic</em>, December 20, 2018), seconds a
        perspective on current debates within the Democratic Socialists of
        America (DSA) that answers his question in the affirmative.
      </p>
      <p>
        DSA, as a result of the energies unleashed around the Bernie Sanders
        campaign and the 2016 election, has experienced such massive growth as
        to have become essentially a new organization. And the current
        controversy within the organization condenses a larger challenge facing
        the left in the United States as we confront the lessons of the victory
        of Trumpism and the need to struggle to contain and defeat it. The
        debate within DSA sharpens the tensions and contradictions around
        defining strategies for charting a way forward in that larger struggle.
        Those tensions resolve down to two basic alternatives: a strategy
        focused centrally on agitating for social-democratic
        programs&#x2014;such as Medicare for All, free public higher education,
        public investment in physical and social infrastructure&#x2014;intended
        to appeal broadly to working people of all races, genders, and sexual
        orientations and one that rejects that focus in favor of efforts to
        mobilize around issues purported to reflect the concerns of groups
        marginalized on the basis of race, immigration status, sexual
        orientation, gender or other categories of ascribed identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within DSA, the debate is anchored, at least in principle, to the
        longer-term goal of social transformation along socialist lines. In that
        context, the first alternative is rooted in a longstanding, conventional
        approach based on mass movement-building. The second proceeds from a
        conviction that, because of the overwhelming power of white supremacy
        (and related systems of oppression) in the United States, the route to
        socialism must give priority to challenging those hierarchies. This view
        rests on a determinist account that construes racism&#x2014;commitment
        to white, male, heteronormative supremacy&#x2014;as the driving
        imperative in American political history and a corollary contention that
        that commitment has vitiated all progressive initiatives in the past and
        will continue to do so. Therefore, albeit incongruously in light of the
        determinism it posits, this approach insists that defeating that
        imperative is a necessary precursor to pursuit of any more general
        leftist agendas. Thus I and
        <a
          target="_blank"

          href="https://nonsite.org/article/the-political-economy-of-anti-racism"

          >race-reductionist</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        One means through which Salazar seeks to validate that second,
        identitarian alternative entails repeating a familiar line of attack on
        Melissa Naschek&#x2019;s
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/08/mistaken-identity-asaid-haider-review-identity-politics"
          >critical review</a
        >
        in <em>Jacobin</em> of Asad Haider&#x2019;s book,
        <em>Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump</em>. And,
        because her review has become a flashpoint for attacks from
        identitarians
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.dsausa.org/weekly/identities-mistaken-where-the-rubber-meets-the-road/"
          >in DSA</a
        >
        and elsewhere, it is worth considering what she actually argues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naschek&#x2019;s judgment, correct in my view, is that Haider&#x2019;s
        book fails because of &#x201C;the shakiness of his historical
        narrative&#x201D; and its &#x201C;shopworn account of the failure of the
        Civil Rights movement to provide an institutional pathway out of
        poverty, causing the emergence of black nationalist ideology in
        response.&#x201D; In part because of this inadequate reading of history,
        she argues, Haider, in asserting that &#x201C;black self-determination
        and socialism are mutually dependent,&#x201D; embraces a &#x201C;do
        both&#x201D; approach to movement-building that enables &#x201C;powerful
        enemies of the Left (and allies of capital) [to] worm their way into our
        coalition and play up identity to reshape working-class demands until
        they&#x2019;re neutralized.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        Oddly, Salazar contends that I &#x201C;helped Naschek craft her
        review.&#x201D; That claim is false and, frankly, offensive. Melissa is
        a friend and comrade politically. When she was working on the review,
        she asked me, as a scholar who specializes in the study of postwar black
        American politics, to offer comments on her draft, which I did. I told
        her I thought the review was great, and that was about that.
        Salazar&#x2019;s assertion may simply reflect his lack of understanding
        of how processes of careful intellectual production work; asking
        colleagues, particularly those with pertinent expertise, for comments on
        work in progress is a normal feature of intellectual practice. In
        context, however, the assertion seems suspiciously like a slur, possibly
        even sexist, carrying an implication that Naschek&#x2019;s critique
        isn&#x2019;t entirely her own, or perhaps an effort to attack her by
        association with someone who has a public track record of objection to
        current strains of race-reductionist politics, like that advocated by
        Haider and others, that seek to define opposition to struggles for
        universalist policies as consistent with a socialist politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salazar also quotes me as having referred on
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://soundcloud.com/deadpundits/ep-67-unlocked-zombies-mistaken-for-identities-w-adolph-reed-jr"
          >a podcast</a
        >
        to Haider&#x2019;s arguments as smelling &#x201C;like a truckload of
        rotten fish.&#x201D; My point in the interview (around
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://soundcloud.com/deadpundits/ep-67-unlocked-zombies-mistaken-for-identities-w-adolph-reed-jr"
          >the 39-minute mark</a
        >) was not about Haider&#x2019;s book at all; I made that comment in
        reference to a much more general, persistent, and corrosive problem in
        political interpretation, of which <em>Mistaken Identity</em> is only a
        recent, and relatively trivial expression. Salazar&#x2019;s
        misrepresentation may stem from faulty memory or a na&#xEF;ve flattening
        of what I said into what he takes to be the implication of what I said.
        It is in either case inaccurate and tendentious.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am sharply critical of Haider&#x2019;s book, as are other specialists
        in the study of black American political history, because it is
        dilettantish and profoundly wrong in its accounts of the dynamics and
        forces shaping black political development since the mid-1960s. Indeed,
        Haider gives away that dilettantism
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4002-zombie-manifesto"
          >in his response</a
        >
        to Naschek&#x2019;s criticism of his assertion that the Combahee River
        Collective is an exemplary guide to contemporary political strategy.
        Naschek notes that &#x201C;the collective was never connected to any
        mass political organization.&#x201D; She goes on:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          To say that they offer a model to building such a program implies that
          any group of academics meeting in a coffee shop has somehow altered
          the landscape of capitalism. Haider takes Combahee&#x2019;s
          declarations of political import as self-evident rather than engaging
          in any critical history of the group&#x2019;s accomplishments.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          It is unfortunately a common practice among modern left public
          intellectuals to assert that the will to pursue political change is
          more important than a group&#x2019;s ability to actually do so. Still
          it is bizarre that a book, which claims to expose the damage liberal
          identity politics has done to socialist politics, should prominently
          showcase one of the former&#x2019;s favorite shibboleths.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Rather than engage seriously with this legitimate critical observation,
        Haider
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4002-zombie-manifesto"
          >pirouettes</a
        >
        to a cheap quip: &#x201C;Naschek dismissively [sic] proclaims that the
        [Combahee River Collective] was not a mass movement. Neither is the
        DSA.&#x201D; That, however, is a disingenuous and wrong-headed
        non-response. Whatever the Combahee River Collective may have been in
        its brief and generally unnoticed existence, it never demonstrated
        aspirations to building a mass political movement. That is, at least in
        its current incarnation, DSA&#x2019;s central mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be clear, I am not and never have been a member of DSA and am not a
        partisan in those internal debates. I do believe, though, that the
        race-reductionist perspective&#x2014;even in its
        &#x201C;both/and&#x201D; variant&#x2014;is, as Naschek and others argue,
        vulnerable to, if not actively aligned with the decidedly anti-Left
        Democratic tendencies associated with Clintonism. That is the key issue
        at stake in the debate over left political strategy, quite apart from
        positional struggle within DSA as an organization, and it is one that
        those, apparently including Salazar and Haider, who object to a strategy
        based on appealing to concerns shared broadly among working people of
        all races, genders, and sexual orientations attempt to finesse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naschek&#x2019;s observation regarding contemporary left public
        intellectuals&#x2019; elevation of the will to pursue political change
        over the capacity to do so is especially important in this regard.
        Haider and others who tout the Combahee River Collective as a model for
        our time do so because its members were black lesbians who espoused a
        generic commitment to &#x201C;liberation,&#x201D; not because of their
        approach to or record of movement-building. In the race-reductionist,
        identitarian world, being displaces doing; what one supposedly is, that
        is, can mean more than what one does or advocates concretely. We saw
        enough of that during the 2018 mid-term elections when we were exhorted
        to celebrate candidacies of various nonwhite, female, gay or lesbian,
        and gender-nonconforming aspirants because of the identity categories
        they embodied rather than the programs they advanced. To be sure, some
        of them embraced left agendas; some decidedly did not, even though they
        may nonetheless have been better options than their Republican
        opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tensions around that identitarian approach erupted in what apparently
        has become a notorious conflict within DSA regarding endorsement of Cat
        Brooks, a black, female candidate in the 2018 Oakland, Califorinia
        mayor&#x2019;s race. Salazar adduces that controversy in his brief
        against the organization&#x2019;s socialist left majority, whom their
        identitarian opponents accused of racial insensitivity for denying
        Brooks the chapter&#x2019;s endorsement. I don&#x2019;t intend to assess
        that particular debate; I don&#x2019;t have adequate local knowledge. I
        do know that those opposing endorsement were circumspect&#x2014;see, for
        example, this
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.eastbaydsa.org/meetings/statements/2018-09-09/cat-brooks-charter-schools/"
          >dispatch on the East Bay DSA&#x2019;s website</a
        >
        about the recency of Brooks&#x2019;s reversal of stance on the charter
        school issue, after several years of prominent association with the
        charter movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salazar invokes a person he describes as &#x201C;Oakland&#x2019;s
        loudest anti-charter activist,&#x201D; who backed her candidacy and who
        characterized his relationship with the candidate as
        &#x201C;complicated,&#x201D; to support a claim that, in effect, she and
        others hadn&#x2019;t understood charterization&#x2019;s destructive
        force because charters &#x201C;were sold to residents as a way to give
        them agency over their own schools.&#x201D; Charterization, his
        informant said, &#x201C;was tied to the self empowerment theme that goes
        back to the Black Panthers.&#x201D; But that justification seems
        uncomfortably akin to &#x201C;I didn&#x2019;t know where I was or what I
        was doing&#x201D; or &#x201C;I was young and needed the money.&#x201D;
        Whether or not Brooks&#x2019;s conversion is genuine, wouldn&#x2019;t
        the earlier error&#x2014;particularly considering the depth and duration
        of her commitment to it&#x2014;justify skepticism with regard to how she
        might respond to other shiny new neoliberal interventions?
      </p>
      <p>
        Recourse to the charge that those who opposed Brooks&#x2019;s
        endorsement were driven by bad racial motives, rather than principled
        political concerns, underscores the dangers of race-reductionist
        politics. (Salazar is in general too willing to retail DSA
        identitarians&#x2019; charges of racial insensitivity. In concluding the
        essay he quotes a tweet from Shanti Singh, a San Francisco DSA
        identitarian, implying that Naschek and her Philadelphia chapter
        co-chair Scott Jenkins were insensitive to the need to counter
        &#x201C;right-wing antisemitism&#x201D; when they proposed not canceling
        a scheduled chapter meeting in order to attend a counter protest of a
        pathetic demonstration by two-dozen equally pathetic wannabe fascist
        Proud Boys. It&#x2019;s unlikely, however, that Naschek, who is Jewish,
        would need sensitivity training about the evils of antisemitism.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This politics is open to the worst forms of opportunism, and it promises
        to be a major front on which neoliberal Democrats will attack the left,
        directly and indirectly, and these lines of attack stand out in
        combining red-baiting and race-baiting into a new, ostensibly
        progressive form of invective. Hillary Clinton&#x2019;s infamous 2016
        campaign swipe at Sanders that his call for breaking up big banks
        wouldn&#x2019;t end racism was only one harbinger of things to come.
        Indeed, we should recall that it was followed hard upon by even more
        blunt attacks from prominent members of the black political class.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the campaign turned to South Carolina, with its large bloc of black
        Democratic voters, the state&#x2019;s black Congressman James Clyburn
        joined Georgia Congressman and icon of the civil rights movement, John
        Lewis, and Louisiana Congressman Cedric Richmond in denouncing Sanders
        as &#x201C;irresponsible&#x201D; in calling for non-commodified public
        goods in education, healthcare and other areas. Lewis sneered:
        &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the wrong message to send any group. There&#x2019;s
        not anything free in America. We all have to pay for something.
        Education is not free. Health care is not free. Food is not free. Water
        is not free. I think it&#x2019;s very misleading to say to the American
        people we&#x2019;re going to give you something free.&#x201D; As I

        in the <em>Baffler</em>, &#x201C;Richmond&#x2019;s rebuke was especially
        telling in that he couched it in terms of his role as chair of the
        Congressional Black Caucus and the group&#x2019;s &#x2018;responsibility
        to make sure that young people know that&#x2019; a social-democratic
        agenda is &#x2018;too good to be true.&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D;

        This points to precisely what is limited, and in the context of the
        current debate over ways forward for the broader left, dangerous about
        the simplistic race-reductionism that Salazar, Haider, and others
        advocate as a necessary accompaniment of, and in practical terms
        precursor, or even alternative to a pursuit of a socialist, or
        social-democratic political agenda. The juxtaposition they assert
        between &#x201C;race&#x201D; or identity and class is bogus. It presumes
        both the fiction that &#x201C;(working) class&#x201D; means
        &#x201C;white&#x201D; and that blacks or other nonwhites and the like
        are somehow outside the capitalist class dynamics that shape American
        life and, most important in this context, politics. As the ideological
        and programmatic commitments of Clyburn, Lewis, Richmond and others in
        the black political elite and chattering classes illustrate, that is
        hardly the case. Moreover, most black people, like other Americans, are
        concerned with finding or keeping decent jobs, housing, health care,
        education, <em>etc</em>.&#x2014;the stuff of a social-democratic agenda.

        Simply put, one either supports such an agenda, or one does not. For the
        first time in most of our lifetimes, we have an opportunity to make
        commitment to that sort of agenda the definitive fault-line in American
        politics for 2020 and beyond. There have been signs since before the
        2016 election that both many Wall Street Democrats and nominally
        progressive identitarians would rather lose than embrace the
        social-democratic left. As we approached the 2018 mid-term elections and
        since, it has become ever clearer that a major struggle between now and
        2020 will be over how we define the &#x201C;progressive&#x201D;
        electoral agenda, whether it should be weighted toward advancing
        candidates who are nonwhite, female, and gender-nonconforming or those
        who support such policy initiatives as Medicare For All. Of course,
        those goals are not necessarily in conflict. The question, though, is
        which should take priority when they are. We must be clear that they are
        not interchangeable.

        That is also a critical point to keep in mind, as we have been and
        increasingly will be confronted with &#x201C;don&#x2019;t let the
        perfect be the enemy of the good&#x201D; liberals, who want, in the name
        of electability or bringing the party together, or whatever else, to
        water down Medicare For All or other components of a social-democratic
        agenda before we&#x2019;ve ever had a serious effort to organize a
        popular base in support of them. It has been and will be all too easy
        for the occasion to elect &#x201C;the first&#x201D; black/Native
        American/woman/lesbian to substitute for the need to advance an agenda
        that can appeal broadly to working people of all races, genders, and
        sexual orientations. Our side&#x2019;s failure to struggle for that sort
        of agenda is one reason Trump is in the White House. We can&#x2019;t
        afford to repeat the mistakes that helped bring about that result.
