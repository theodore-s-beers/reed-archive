        Miguel Salazar in a recent essay purporting to address the question “<a

          href="https://newrepublic.com/article/152789/americas-socialists-race-problem"
          >Do America’s Socialists Have a Race Problem?</a
        >” (<em>The New Republic</em>, December 20, 2018), seconds a perspective
        on current debates within the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)
        that answers his question in the affirmative.
      </p>
      <p>
        DSA, as a result of the energies unleashed around the Bernie Sanders
        campaign and the 2016 election, has experienced such massive growth as
        to have become essentially a new organization. And the current
        controversy within the organization condenses a larger challenge facing
        the left in the United States as we confront the lessons of the victory
        of Trumpism and the need to struggle to contain and defeat it. The
        debate within DSA sharpens the tensions and contradictions around
        defining strategies for charting a way forward in that larger struggle.
        Those tensions resolve down to two basic alternatives: a strategy
        focused centrally on agitating for social-democratic programs—such as
        Medicare for All, free public higher education, public investment in
        physical and social infrastructure—intended to appeal broadly to working
        people of all races, genders, and sexual orientations and one that
        rejects that focus in favor of efforts to mobilize around issues
        purported to reflect the concerns of groups marginalized on the basis of
        race, immigration status, sexual orientation, gender or other categories
        of ascribed identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within DSA, the debate is anchored, at least in principle, to the
        longer-term goal of social transformation along socialist lines. In that
        context, the first alternative is rooted in a longstanding, conventional
        approach based on mass movement-building. The second proceeds from a
        conviction that, because of the overwhelming power of white supremacy
        (and related systems of oppression) in the United States, the route to
        socialism must give priority to challenging those hierarchies. This view
        rests on a determinist account that construes racism—commitment to
        white, male, heteronormative supremacy—as the driving imperative in
        American political history and a corollary contention that that
        commitment has vitiated all progressive initiatives in the past and will
        continue to do so. Therefore, albeit incongruously in light of the
        determinism it posits, this approach insists that defeating that
        imperative is a necessary precursor to pursuit of any more general
        leftist agendas. Thus I and
        <a
          target="_blank"

          href="https://nonsite.org/article/the-political-economy-of-anti-racism"

        that its guiding perspective is

        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        One means through which Salazar seeks to validate that second,
        identitarian alternative entails repeating a familiar line of attack on
        Melissa Naschek’s
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/08/mistaken-identity-asaid-haider-review-identity-politics"
          >critical review</a
        >
        in <em>Jacobin</em> of Asad Haider’s book,
        <em>Mistaken Identity: Race and Class in the Age of Trump</em>. And,
        because her review has become a flashpoint for attacks from
        identitarians
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.dsausa.org/weekly/identities-mistaken-where-the-rubber-meets-the-road/"
          >in DSA</a
        >
        and elsewhere, it is worth considering what she actually argues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naschek’s judgment, correct in my view, is that Haider’s book fails
        because of “the shakiness of his historical narrative” and its “shopworn
        account of the failure of the Civil Rights movement to provide an
        institutional pathway out of poverty, causing the emergence of black
        nationalist ideology in response.” In part because of this inadequate
        reading of history, she argues, Haider, in asserting that “black
        self-determination and socialism are mutually dependent,” embraces a “do
        both” approach to movement-building that enables “powerful enemies of
        the Left (and allies of capital) [to] worm their way into our coalition
        and play up identity to reshape working-class demands until they’re
        neutralized.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Oddly, Salazar contends that I “helped Naschek craft her review.” That
        claim is false and, frankly, offensive. Melissa is a friend and comrade
        politically. When she was working on the review, she asked me, as a
        scholar who specializes in the study of postwar black American politics,
        to offer comments on her draft, which I did. I told her I thought the
        review was great, and that was about that. Salazar’s assertion may
        simply reflect his lack of understanding of how processes of careful
        intellectual production work; asking colleagues, particularly those with
        pertinent expertise, for comments on work in progress is a normal
        feature of intellectual practice. In context, however, the assertion
        seems suspiciously like a slur, possibly even sexist, carrying an
        implication that Naschek’s critique isn’t entirely her own, or perhaps
        an effort to attack her by association with someone who has a public
        track record of objection to current strains of race-reductionist
        politics, like that advocated by Haider and others, that seek to define
        opposition to struggles for universalist policies as consistent with a
        socialist politics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salazar also quotes me as having referred on
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://soundcloud.com/deadpundits/ep-67-unlocked-zombies-mistaken-for-identities-w-adolph-reed-jr"
          >a podcast</a
        >
        to Haider’s arguments as smelling “like a truckload of rotten fish.” My
        point in the interview (around
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://soundcloud.com/deadpundits/ep-67-unlocked-zombies-mistaken-for-identities-w-adolph-reed-jr"
          >the 39-minute mark</a
        >) was not about Haider’s book at all; I made that comment in reference
        to a much more general, persistent, and corrosive problem in political
        interpretation, of which <em>Mistaken Identity</em> is only a recent,
        and relatively trivial expression. Salazar’s misrepresentation may stem
        from faulty memory or a naïve flattening of what I said into what he
        takes to be the implication of what I said. It is in either case
        inaccurate and tendentious.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am sharply critical of Haider’s book, as are other specialists in the
        study of black American political history, because it is dilettantish
        and profoundly wrong in its accounts of the dynamics and forces shaping
        black political development since the mid-1960s. Indeed, Haider gives
        away that dilettantism
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4002-zombie-manifesto"
          >in his response</a
        >
        to Naschek’s criticism of his assertion that the Combahee River
        Collective is an exemplary guide to contemporary political strategy.
        Naschek notes that “the collective was never connected to any mass
        political organization.” She goes on:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          To say that they offer a model to building such a program implies that
          any group of academics meeting in a coffee shop has somehow altered
          the landscape of capitalism. Haider takes Combahee’s declarations of
          political import as self-evident rather than engaging in any critical
          history of the group’s accomplishments.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          It is unfortunately a common practice among modern left public
          intellectuals to assert that the will to pursue political change is
          more important than a group’s ability to actually do so. Still it is
          bizarre that a book, which claims to expose the damage liberal
          identity politics has done to socialist politics, should prominently
          showcase one of the former’s favorite shibboleths.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Rather than engage seriously with this legitimate critical observation,
        Haider
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4002-zombie-manifesto"
          >pirouettes</a
        >
        to a cheap quip: “Naschek dismissively [sic] proclaims that the
        [Combahee River Collective] was not a mass movement. Neither is the
        DSA.” That, however, is a disingenuous and wrong-headed non-response.
        Whatever the Combahee River Collective may have been in its brief and
        generally unnoticed existence, it never demonstrated aspirations to
        building a mass political movement. That is, at least in its current
        incarnation, DSA’s central mission.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be clear, I am not and never have been a member of DSA and am not a
        partisan in those internal debates. I do believe, though, that the
        race-reductionist perspective—even in its “both/and” variant—is, as
        Naschek and others argue, vulnerable to, if not actively aligned with
        the decidedly anti-Left Democratic tendencies associated with
        Clintonism. That is the key issue at stake in the debate over left
        political strategy, quite apart from positional struggle within DSA as
        an organization, and it is one that those, apparently including Salazar
        and Haider, who object to a strategy based on appealing to concerns
        shared broadly among working people of all races, genders, and sexual
        orientations attempt to finesse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Naschek’s observation regarding contemporary left public intellectuals’
        elevation of the will to pursue political change over the capacity to do
        so is especially important in this regard. Haider and others who tout
        the Combahee River Collective as a model for our time do so because its
        members were black lesbians who espoused a generic commitment to
        “liberation,” not because of their approach to or record of
        movement-building. In the race-reductionist, identitarian world, being
        displaces doing; what one supposedly is, that is, can mean more than
        what one does or advocates concretely. We saw enough of that during the
        2018 mid-term elections when we were exhorted to celebrate candidacies
        of various nonwhite, female, gay or lesbian, and gender-nonconforming
        aspirants because of the identity categories they embodied rather than
        the programs they advanced. To be sure, some of them embraced left
        agendas; some decidedly did not, even though they may nonetheless have
        been better options than their Republican opponents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tensions around that identitarian approach erupted in what apparently
        has become a notorious conflict within DSA regarding endorsement of Cat
        Brooks, a black, female candidate in the 2018 Oakland, Califorinia
        mayor’s race. Salazar adduces that controversy in his brief against the
        organization’s socialist left majority, whom their identitarian
        opponents accused of racial insensitivity for denying Brooks the
        chapter’s endorsement. I don’t intend to assess that particular debate;
        I don’t have adequate local knowledge. I do know that those opposing
        endorsement were circumspect—see, for example, this
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.eastbaydsa.org/meetings/statements/2018-09-09/cat-brooks-charter-schools/"
          >dispatch on the East Bay DSA’s website</a
        >
        about the recency of Brooks’s reversal of stance on the charter school
        issue, after several years of prominent association with the charter
        movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Salazar invokes a person he describes as “Oakland’s loudest anti-charter
        activist,” who backed her candidacy and who characterized his
        relationship with the candidate as “complicated,” to support a claim
        that, in effect, she and others hadn’t understood charterization’s
        destructive force because charters “were sold to residents as a way to
        give them agency over their own schools.” Charterization, his informant
        said, “was tied to the self empowerment theme that goes back to the
        Black Panthers.” But that justification seems uncomfortably akin to “I
        didn’t know where I was or what I was doing” or “I was young and needed
        the money.” Whether or not Brooks’s conversion is genuine, wouldn’t the
        earlier error—particularly considering the depth and duration of her
        commitment to it—justify skepticism with regard to how she might respond
        to other shiny new neoliberal interventions?
      </p>
      <p>
        Recourse to the charge that those who opposed Brooks’s endorsement were
        driven by bad racial motives, rather than principled political concerns,
        underscores the dangers of race-reductionist politics. (Salazar is in
        general too willing to retail DSA identitarians’ charges of racial
        insensitivity. In concluding the essay he quotes a tweet from Shanti
        Singh, a San Francisco DSA identitarian, implying that Naschek and her
        Philadelphia chapter co-chair Scott Jenkins were insensitive to the need
        to counter “right-wing antisemitism” when they proposed not canceling a
        scheduled chapter meeting in order to attend a counter protest of a
        pathetic demonstration by two-dozen equally pathetic wannabe fascist
        Proud Boys. It’s unlikely, however, that Naschek, who is Jewish, would
        need sensitivity training about the evils of antisemitism.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This politics is open to the worst forms of opportunism, and it promises
        to be a major front on which neoliberal Democrats will attack the left,
        directly and indirectly, and these lines of attack stand out in
        combining red-baiting and race-baiting into a new, ostensibly
        progressive form of invective. Hillary Clinton’s infamous 2016 campaign
        swipe at Sanders that his call for breaking up big banks wouldn’t end
        racism was only one harbinger of things to come. Indeed, we should
        recall that it was followed hard upon by even more blunt attacks from
        prominent members of the black political class.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the campaign turned to South Carolina, with its large bloc of black
        Democratic voters, the state’s black Congressman James Clyburn joined
        Georgia Congressman and icon of the civil rights movement, John Lewis,
        and Louisiana Congressman Cedric Richmond in denouncing Sanders as
        “irresponsible” in calling for non-commodified public goods in
        education, healthcare and other areas. Lewis sneered: “It’s the wrong
        message to send any group. There’s not anything free in America. We all
        have to pay for something. Education is not free. Health care is not
        free. Food is not free. Water is not free. I think it’s very misleading
        to say to the American people we’re going to give you something free.”
        As I
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-trouble-with-uplift-reed"
          >pointed out</a
        >
        in the <em>Baffler</em>, “Richmond’s rebuke was especially telling in
        that he couched it in terms of his role as chair of the Congressional
        Black Caucus and the group’s ‘responsibility to make sure that young
        people know that’ a social-democratic agenda is ‘too good to be true.’ ”
      </p>
      <p>
        This points to precisely what is limited, and in the context of the
        current debate over ways forward for the broader left, dangerous about
        the simplistic race-reductionism that Salazar, Haider, and others
        advocate as a necessary accompaniment of, and in practical terms
        precursor, or even alternative to a pursuit of a socialist, or
        social-democratic political agenda. The juxtaposition they assert
        between “race” or identity and class is bogus. It presumes both the
        fiction that “(working) class” means “white” and that blacks or other
        nonwhites and the like are somehow outside the capitalist class dynamics
        that shape American life and, most important in this context, politics.
        As the ideological and programmatic commitments of Clyburn, Lewis,
        Richmond and others in the black political elite and chattering classes
        illustrate, that is hardly the case. Moreover, most black people, like
        other Americans, are concerned with finding or keeping decent jobs,
        housing, health care, education, <em>etc</em>.—the stuff of a
        social-democratic agenda. Hence Bernie Sanders’s approval
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2018/12/17/how-come-so-many-bernie-bros-are-women-and-people-color"
          >ratings remain higher among black Americans</a
        >
        than any other group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply put, one either supports such an agenda, or one does not. For the
        first time in most of our lifetimes, we have an opportunity to make
        commitment to that sort of agenda the definitive fault-line in American
        politics for 2020 and beyond. There have been signs since before the
        2016 election that both many Wall Street Democrats and nominally
        progressive identitarians would rather lose than embrace the
        social-democratic left. As we approached the 2018 mid-term elections and
        since, it has become ever clearer that a major struggle between now and
        2020 will be over how we define the “progressive” electoral agenda,
        whether it should be weighted toward advancing candidates who are
        nonwhite, female, and gender-nonconforming or those who support such
        policy initiatives as Medicare For All. Of course, those goals are not
        necessarily in conflict. The question, though, is which should take
        priority when they are. We must be clear that they are not
        interchangeable.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is also a critical point to keep in mind, as we have been and
        increasingly will be confronted with “don’t let the perfect be the enemy
        of the good” liberals, who want, in the name of electability or bringing
        the party together, or whatever else, to water down Medicare For All or
        other components of a social-democratic agenda before we’ve ever had a
        serious effort to organize a popular base in support of them. It has
        been and will be all too easy for the occasion to elect “the first”
        black/Native American/woman/lesbian to substitute for the need to
        advance an agenda that can appeal broadly to working people of all
        races, genders, and sexual orientations. Our side’s failure to struggle
        for that sort of agenda is one reason Trump is in the White House. We
        can’t afford to repeat the mistakes that helped bring about that result.
      </p>
