      <p>
        In recent years the image of an urban &#x201C;underclass&#x201D; has
        become the central representation of poverty in American society. In
        less than a decade the underclass took hold of the public imagination,
        and came to shape policymakers&#x2019; agendas concerning issues of
        race, urban decay, and social welfare. But what is the underclass? What
        is so compelling about that image? What is its significance in American
        political life?
      </p>
      <p>
        The underclass idea rests on fuzzy and disturbing assumptions about poor
        people, poverty, and the world in which both are reproduced. Those
        assumptions amount to tacit&#x2014;and sometimes explicit&#x2014;claims
        regarding the defective nature of poor people&#x2019;s motivations,
        moral character, and behavior. They appeal to hoary prejudices of race,
        gender, and class which give the upper-class image instant acceptance
        and verisimilitude even though it is ambiguous and inconsistent on its
        own terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right-wing, mean-spirited beliefs about poor people have come to suffuse
        even self-consciously liberal, technocratic policy discussion. Such
        supposed &#x201C;friends of the poor&#x201D; as Charles Murray, Lawrence
        Mead, Nicholas Lemann, Mickey Kaus, Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams,
        Robert Woodson, and Glen Loury assume the need to correct, or at least
        to take into account, poor people&#x2019;s defective tendencies as an
        essential limit on social policy. The reactionary, purely ideological
        foundation of the underclass idea becomes clear on close examination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the term has been around for longer, it caught fire in popular
        and academic circles after Ken Auletta canonized it in 1982 in
        <em>The Underclass</em>, a journalistic, mock-ethnographic essay
        originally serialized in the <em>New Yorker</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Auletta began by joining &#x201C;poverty&#x201D; and &#x201C;antisocial
        behavior&#x201D; as equivalent qualifications for underclass status.
        &#x201C;The underclass need not be poor&#x2014;street criminals, for
        instance, usually are not,&#x201D; he wrote. &#x201C;The underclass
        usually operates outside the generally accepted boundaries of society.
        They are often set apart by their &#x2018;deviant&#x2019; or antisocial
        behavior, by their bad habits, not just their poverty.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        Auletta mused that we might not want to include those who
        &#x201C;actually earn a living in the underground economy&#x201D; and
        maybe &#x201C;add illegal, or undocumented aliens,&#x201D; and he
        wondered whether &#x201C;those with serious mental illness [should] be
        counted.&#x201D; In a pinch, for a quick, quasi-empirical referent,
        however, he called up the holy trinity of &#x201C;welfare mothers,
        ex-convicts, and drug addicts.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        For Mickey Kaus, writing in the <em>New Republic</em>, the underclass is
        the &#x201C;black lower class&#x201D; for whom &#x201C;the work ethic
        has evaporated and the entrepreneurial drive is channeled into gangs and
        drug-pushing.&#x201D; Culture figures prominently in Kaus&#x2019;s
        outlook. In addition to the culture of poverty, he asserts the existence
        of a &#x201C;single-parent culture,&#x201D; a &#x201C;welfare
        culture,&#x201D; a &#x201C;culture of single motherhood&#x201D;
        (presumably a more specific articulation of the single-parent culture),
        a &#x201C;working, taxpaying culture,&#x201D; and a &#x201C;work-ethic
        culture.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        Nicholas Lemann never tells us exactly how we can identify a member of
        his underclass. In his nearest attempt at definition, he simply
        announces that &#x201C;blacks are splitting into a middle class and an
        underclass that seems likely never to make it.&#x201D; He tells us that
        the underclass suffers from a &#x201C;strongly self-defeating
        culture&#x201D; which has its roots in the sharecrop system and whose
        centerpiece seems to be out-of-wedlock birth. That, however, is as
        precise as Lemann gets. He does volunteer, though, that this ghetto
        culture is &#x201C;venerable&#x201D; and &#x201C;disorganized&#x201D;
        and that its members need training in some equally vague
        &#x201C;bourgeois values.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        Within four months of publication of Kaus&#x2019;s and Lemann&#x2019;s
        articles, Richard Nathan, then of Princeton&#x2019;s prestigious Woodrow
        Wilson School, declared it was time to shut off debate about the
        usefulness, empirical soundness, or implications of the underclass
        notion. We should, he suggested, follow the media in using the term
        &#x201C;as a shorthand expression of the concentration of economic and
        behavioral problems among racial minorities (mainly black and Hispanic)
        in large, older cities.&#x201D; This underclass is &#x201C;not just a
        function of being poor. It involves geography and behavior.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        Isabel Sawhill, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, similarly proceeds
        from the authoritative imagery of &#x201C;television and newspaper
        stories&#x201D; which document the existence of the underclass. Again,
        the underclass&#x2019;s behavior is its &#x201C;most distinctive, most
        interesting, and most troubling&#x201D; characteristic.
      </p>
      <center>&#xFF0A;&#x2003;&#xFF0A;&#x2003;&#xFF0A;</center>
      <p>
        The underclass appeals entirely as a powerful metaphor; its resonance
        has far outpaced its empirical content, and it has thrived as a concept
        in search of its object. Most who find the notion attractive agree that
        the underclass is mainly urban and largely nonwhite. They typically
        agree as well that it constitutes approximately 10 to 20 percent of the
        poverty population. That percentage, however, is produced by sleight of
        hand. The number, glibly repeated by journalists and professional
        statisticians of poverty, has become the consensual estimate without
        justificatory argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ultimate source of this estimate, instructively, may be Oscar Lewis,
        <em>auteur</em> of the &#x201C;culture of poverty,&#x201D; the last
        generation&#x2019;s effort to ground a behavioral focus on poverty in
        the authority of social science. Lewis speculated that &#x201C;about 20
        percent of the population below the poverty line&#x201D; fell into his
        poverty culture. But his speculation had no sounder basis than
        contemporary punditry. He characterized it as a belief and a
        &#x201C;rough guess&#x201D; and offered no supporting evidence or
        argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the consensus on the size of the underclass, it is not clear
        exactly what joins the various aggregations of people said to constitute
        the underclass. What makes street crime and teen pregnancy signifiers of
        a common population? Does participation in an underground economy not
        suggest just the opposite of an evaporated work ethic? How exactly does
        out-of-wedlock birth become an instance of social pathology?
      </p>
      <p>
        If a thirty-five-year-old lawyer decides to have a baby without seal of
        approval from church or state or enduring male affiliation, we do not
        consider her to be acting pathologically; we may even laud her
        independence and refusal to knuckle under to patriarchal conventions.
        Why does such a birth become pathological when it occurs in the
        maternity ward in Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx, say, rather than
        within the pastel walls of an alternative birthing center?
      </p>
      <p>
        If a woman&#x2019;s decision expresses pathology because she makes it in
        poverty, then we have fallen into a tautology: she is poor because she
        is pathological because she is poor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the problem stems from reliance on mystical assumptions about
        class, attitudes, behavior, values, and culture. Underclass
        constructions revise the old nature/culture dichotomy, in which
        &#x201C;culture&#x201D; stood for the principle of human plasticity and
        adaptation&#x2014;in the old, Enlightenment view, the agency of
        progress. Instead, the power of the underclass idea derives from its
        naturalization of &#x201C;culture&#x201D; as an independent force that
        undermines adaptability and retards progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Culture-of-poverty ideology resuscitates the idea of cultural lag,
        itself a vestige of antique notions of racial temperament.
      </p>
      <p>
        The underclass image proceeds from a view of class in general that
        strikingly resembles Victorian convention. Victorians often used
        &#x201C;class&#x201D; and &#x201C;race&#x201D; interchangeably; each
        category was seen as innate. Class and race essences generally were
        thought to include&#x2014;in addition to distinctive
        physiognomy&#x2014;values, attitudes, and behavior. Thus, Victorian
        fiction commonly featured characters in humble circumstances who, though
        unaware of their true, genteel natal origins, always felt ill at ease or
        out of place among their coarse fellows, as well as other characters
        whose base derivations, unknown even to themselves, nonetheless brought
        them low in polite society.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Victorian resonances come out in the rhetorical moves and chains of
        inference current culture-of-poverty thinkers employ as they seek to
        construct meticulous, apparently social-scientific descriptions of an
        objectively existing underclass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Richard Nathan, for example, might be able to adduce evidence supporting
        his contentions about the prevalence of crime, prostitution, drugs,
        long-term welfare use, and homelessness, but &#x201C;lack of will and
        commitment to get an education or a regular job&#x201D; cannot be
        ascertained from the data at his disposal. On what does he base that
        inference? He avoids justifying it by slipping it into a list of
        categories for which he could marshal plausible evidence. Isabel Sawhill
        suggests that as dysfunctional behaviors &#x201C;become commonplace,
        they are likely to become more acceptable.&#x201D; Both scholars presume
        to know people&#x2019;s motivations without interviewing them or taking
        account of their self-understandings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is compounded by another subtle but critical elision: the
        assumption that census tracts are synonymous with neighborhoods.
        Analysis of aggregate socioeconomic and demographic characteristics from
        census tracts does not inform our understanding of patterns of
        interaction or the character of norms, values, and aspirations in a
        group of people who live together. Nevertheless, the elision has become
        institutionalized in the poverty-research industry, and debate occurs
        now only over which batches of indicators and what thresholds of them
        most satisfactorily mark an underclass area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those laundry lists of characteristics also entail a questionable
        extension of the category &#x201C;behavior&#x201D; to phenomena that
        might only indirectly be products of human agency. Female
        household-heading, for example, can result from a number of
        circumstances entirely beyond the control of women whose lives are
        compressed into that label. The same applies to unemployment or
        underemployment, and even long-term status as a welfare recipient can
        stem completely from impersonal forces. Characterizing those phenomena
        as behavior reveals a zeal for validating the underclass concept, and a
        fundamental inclination to seek the sources of poverty in deficiencies
        of individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        All versions of the underclass notion center on the behavior of its
        categorical members, though liberals typically hedge with genuflections
        toward the ultimate weight of historical or structural forces. (The
        differences on that score, however, are not great. Conservatives also
        frequently genuflect toward structural pressures and past oppression
        before enunciating one or another brand of tough-love remedy for the
        present.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Why, though, does the underclass idea appeal so powerfully to
        people&#x2014;including disciplined scholars&#x2014;even as they must
        perform elaborate, dubious maneuvers to define it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the notion&#x2019;s popularity is driven by the sociology of the
        policy research community. Technocratic discourse and methods nurture
        ideas that depoliticize the frame for examining social problems. The
        underclass formulation is attractive precisely because it does not exist
        as anyone&#x2019;s self-description. It is purely a statistical
        artifact, and therefore exclusively the creation and property of its
        chroniclers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The underclass notion also appeals to several ideological dispositions.
        Most immediately it resonates with the ahistorical individualism rampant
        in the Reagan/Bush/Clinton era. As a corollary, it is attractive to many
        petit bourgeois blacks because it flatters their success by comparison
        and, through the insipid role model rhetoric, allows fawning over the
        allegedly special, tutelary role of the black middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of a behaviorally defined underclass also affirms an ensemble
        of racial and class prejudices that lurk beneath an apparently
        innocuous, certainly stupid tendency to reduce the social world to
        aggregates of good people and bad people. Simply, good people are people
        like &#x201C;us&#x201D;; bad people are not, and the same behavior is
        assessed differently depending on the category into which the
        perpetrator falls.
      </p>
      <p>
        An eighteen-year-old drug courier with a monogrammed BMW is
        pathological; an arbitrageur who strays too far onto the wrong side of
        legality is too clever for his own good&#x2014;the stuff of tragedy.
        Dependency on AFDC breeds sloth and pathology; dependency on military
        contracts, tax abatements, or FHA loans does a patriotic service for the
        country, incubates family values, and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the underclass notion may receive the greatest ideological
        boost from pure sexism. For drug-crazed, lawless black and Hispanic men,
        the companion image is the so-called &#x201C;cycle of poverty,&#x201D;
        which focuses on women&#x2019;s living and reproductive practices as the
        transmission belt that drives the cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rhetoric of &#x201C;family values,&#x201D; and of
        &#x201C;disorganization,&#x201D; &#x201C;deterioration,&#x201D; and
        &#x201C;disintegration&#x201D; stigmatizes female-headed households,
        which now are home to a majority of American children, and applies a
        hierarchy of propriety to the conjugal arrangements within which women
        might give birth. Of the master list of empirical indicators of
        pathology, most are observable only in women.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are already seeing the policy fruit that this imagery bears. A judge
        in Kansas City has ordered children to use their absent fathers&#x2019;
        names, presumably to strengthen obligation by establishing ownership. A
        Kansas state legislator has argued that impoverished women should be
        induced to accept Norplant birth-control implants as a way to hold down
        welfare costs and cut the size of the recipient population.
      </p>
      <p>
        State welfare departments have taken up marriage brokering, as in a
        Wisconsin plan to offer cash inducements for women who marry their way
        off AFDC and to cut benefits for &#x201C;unwed teenage mothers.&#x201D;
        These moves demonstrate unambiguously the repressive, antifeminist
        outlook lurking beneath the focus on family. (In 1996, this repressive
        impetus culminated in Congress&#x2019;s passage of the Personal
        Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, which eliminated
        AFDC. The Act was signed by President Clinton, who boasted that it was
        the fulfillment of his 1992 campaign pledge to &#x201C;end welfare as we
        know it.&#x201D;)
      </p>
      <center>&#xFF0A;&#x2003;&#xFF0A;&#x2003;&#xFF0A;</center>
      <p>
        How, then, should we talk about those who are stigmatized as the
        &#x201C;underclass&#x201D;? First, it is imperative to reject all
        assumptions that poor people are behaviorally or attitudinally different
        from the rest of American society. Some percentage of
        <em>all</em> Americans take drugs, fight in families, and abuse or
        neglect children. If the behavior exists across lines of class, race,
        and opportunity, then it cannot reasonably be held to produce poverty.
        If it does not <em>cause</em> poverty, therefore, we do not need to
        focus on it at all in the context of policy-oriented discussion about
        poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
        We should also fight against lurid, exploitative journalism that
        reproduces obnoxious class and racial prejudices. And we should be
        prepared to recognize the extent to which such prejudices infiltrate
        even ostensibly more careful, allegedly sympathetic depictions and
        expose them for what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Affirmatively, we should insist on returning the focus of the discussion
        of the production and reproduction of poverty to examination of its
        sources in the operations of the American political and economic system.
        Specifically, the discussion should focus on such phenomena as the logic
        of deindustrialization, models of urban redevelopment driven by
        real-estate speculation, the general intensification of polarization of
        wealth, income, and opportunity in American society, the ways in which
        race and gender figure into those dynamics, and, not least, the role of
        public policy in reproducing and legitimating them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, we should fight for policy changes that will open opportunity
        structures: support for improving access to jobs, housing, schooling,
        real drug rehabilitation of the sort available to the relatively
        well-off. A focus on behavior, after all, leads into a blind alley in
        policy terms. If we say that poor people are poor because they have bad
        values, we let government off the hook, even though conscious government
        policy&#x2014;for example, in the relations between support for
        metropolitan real estate speculation and increasing homelessness,
        malnutrition, and infant mortality&#x2014;is directly implicated in
        causing poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, with respect to the litany of moral repressiveness that seems
        to be obligatory these days, I want the record to show that I do not
        want to hear another word about drugs or crime without hearing in the
        same breath about decent jobs, adequate housing, and egalitarian
        education.
