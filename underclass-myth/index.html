      <p>
        In recent years the image of an urban “underclass” has become the
        central representation of poverty in American society. In less than a
        decade the underclass took hold of the public imagination, and came to
        shape policymakers’ agendas concerning issues of race, urban decay, and
        social welfare. But what is the underclass? What is so compelling about
        that image? What is its significance in American political life?
      </p>
      <p>
        The underclass idea rests on fuzzy and disturbing assumptions about poor
        people, poverty, and the world in which both are reproduced. Those
        assumptions amount to tacit—and sometimes explicit—claims regarding the
        defective nature of poor people’s motivations, moral character, and
        behavior. They appeal to hoary prejudices of race, gender, and class
        which give the upper-class image instant acceptance and verisimilitude
        even though it is ambiguous and inconsistent on its own terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right-wing, mean-spirited beliefs about poor people have come to suffuse
        even self-consciously liberal, technocratic policy discussion. Such
        supposed “friends of the poor” as Charles Murray, Lawrence Mead,
        Nicholas Lemann, Mickey Kaus, Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams, Robert
        Woodson, and Glen Loury assume the need to correct, or at least to take
        into account, poor people’s defective tendencies as an essential limit
        on social policy. The reactionary, purely ideological foundation of the
        underclass idea becomes clear on close examination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the term has been around for longer, it caught fire in popular
        and academic circles after Ken Auletta canonized it in 1982 in
        <em>The Underclass</em>, a journalistic, mock-ethnographic essay
        originally serialized in the <em>New Yorker</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Auletta began by joining “poverty” and “antisocial behavior” as
        equivalent qualifications for underclass status. “The underclass need
        not be poor—street criminals, for instance, usually are not,” he wrote.
        “The underclass usually operates outside the generally accepted
        boundaries of society. They are often set apart by their ‘deviant’ or
        antisocial behavior, by their bad habits, not just their poverty.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Auletta mused that we might not want to include those who “actually earn
        a living in the underground economy” and maybe “add illegal, or
        undocumented aliens,” and he wondered whether “those with serious mental
        illness [should] be counted.” In a pinch, for a quick, quasi-empirical
        referent, however, he called up the holy trinity of “welfare mothers,
        ex-convicts, and drug addicts.”
      </p>
      <p>
        For Mickey Kaus, writing in the <em>New Republic</em>, the underclass is
        the “black lower class” for whom “the work ethic has evaporated and the
        entrepreneurial drive is channeled into gangs and drug-pushing.” Culture
        figures prominently in Kaus’s outlook. In addition to the culture of
        poverty, he asserts the existence of a “single-parent culture,” a
        “welfare culture,” a “culture of single motherhood” (presumably a more
        specific articulation of the single-parent culture), a “working,
        taxpaying culture,” and a “work-ethic culture.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Nicholas Lemann never tells us exactly how we can identify a member of
        his underclass. In his nearest attempt at definition, he simply
        announces that “blacks are splitting into a middle class and an
        underclass that seems likely never to make it.” He tells us that the
        underclass suffers from a “strongly self-defeating culture” which has
        its roots in the sharecrop system and whose centerpiece seems to be
        out-of-wedlock birth. That, however, is as precise as Lemann gets. He
        does volunteer, though, that this ghetto culture is “venerable” and
        “disorganized” and that its members need training in some equally vague
        “bourgeois values.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Within four months of publication of Kaus’s and Lemann’s articles,
        Richard Nathan, then of Princeton’s prestigious Woodrow Wilson School,
        declared it was time to shut off debate about the usefulness, empirical
        soundness, or implications of the underclass notion. We should, he
        suggested, follow the media in using the term “as a shorthand expression
        of the concentration of economic and behavioral problems among racial
        minorities (mainly black and Hispanic) in large, older cities.” This
        underclass is “not just a function of being poor. It involves geography
        and behavior.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Isabel Sawhill, senior fellow at the Urban Institute, similarly proceeds
        from the authoritative imagery of “television and newspaper stories”
        which document the existence of the underclass. Again, the underclass’s
        behavior is its “most distinctive, most interesting, and most troubling”
        characteristic.
      </p>
      <p class="separator">＊ ＊ ＊</p>
      <p>
        The underclass appeals entirely as a powerful metaphor; its resonance
        has far outpaced its empirical content, and it has thrived as a concept
        in search of its object. Most who find the notion attractive agree that
        the underclass is mainly urban and largely nonwhite. They typically
        agree as well that it constitutes approximately 10 to 20 percent of the
        poverty population. That percentage, however, is produced by sleight of
        hand. The number, glibly repeated by journalists and professional
        statisticians of poverty, has become the consensual estimate without
        justificatory argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ultimate source of this estimate, instructively, may be Oscar Lewis,
        <em>auteur</em> of the “culture of poverty,” the last generation’s
        effort to ground a behavioral focus on poverty in the authority of
        social science. Lewis speculated that “about 20 percent of the
        population below the poverty line” fell into his poverty culture. But
        his speculation had no sounder basis than contemporary punditry. He
        characterized it as a belief and a “rough guess” and offered no
        supporting evidence or argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the consensus on the size of the underclass, it is not clear
        exactly what joins the various aggregations of people said to constitute
        the underclass. What makes street crime and teen pregnancy signifiers of
        a common population? Does participation in an underground economy not
        suggest just the opposite of an evaporated work ethic? How exactly does
        out-of-wedlock birth become an instance of social pathology?
      </p>
      <p>
        If a thirty-five-year-old lawyer decides to have a baby without seal of
        approval from church or state or enduring male affiliation, we do not
        consider her to be acting pathologically; we may even laud her
        independence and refusal to knuckle under to patriarchal conventions.
        Why does such a birth become pathological when it occurs in the
        maternity ward in Lincoln Hospital in the South Bronx, say, rather than
        within the pastel walls of an alternative birthing center?
      </p>
      <p>
        If a woman’s decision expresses pathology because she makes it in
        poverty, then we have fallen into a tautology: she is poor because she
        is pathological because she is poor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the problem stems from reliance on mystical assumptions about
        class, attitudes, behavior, values, and culture. Underclass
        constructions revise the old nature/culture dichotomy, in which
        “culture” stood for the principle of human plasticity and adaptation—in
        the old, Enlightenment view, the agency of progress. Instead, the power
        of the underclass idea derives from its naturalization of “culture” as
        an independent force that undermines adaptability and retards progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Culture-of-poverty ideology resuscitates the idea of cultural lag,
        itself a vestige of antique notions of racial temperament.
      </p>
      <p>
        The underclass image proceeds from a view of class in general that
        strikingly resembles Victorian convention. Victorians often used “class”
        and “race” interchangeably; each category was seen as innate. Class and
        race essences generally were thought to include—in addition to
        distinctive physiognomy—values, attitudes, and behavior. Thus, Victorian
        fiction commonly featured characters in humble circumstances who, though
        unaware of their true, genteel natal origins, always felt ill at ease or
        out of place among their coarse fellows, as well as other characters
        whose base derivations, unknown even to themselves, nonetheless brought
        them low in polite society.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Victorian resonances come out in the rhetorical moves and chains of
        inference current culture-of-poverty thinkers employ as they seek to
        construct meticulous, apparently social-scientific descriptions of an
        objectively existing underclass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Richard Nathan, for example, might be able to adduce evidence supporting
        his contentions about the prevalence of crime, prostitution, drugs,
        long-term welfare use, and homelessness, but “lack of will and
        commitment to get an education or a regular job” cannot be ascertained
        from the data at his disposal. On what does he base that inference? He
        avoids justifying it by slipping it into a list of categories for which
        he could marshal plausible evidence. Isabel Sawhill suggests that as
        dysfunctional behaviors “become commonplace, they are likely to become
        more acceptable.” Both scholars presume to know people’s motivations
        without interviewing them or taking account of their
        self-understandings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is compounded by another subtle but critical elision: the
        assumption that census tracts are synonymous with neighborhoods.
        Analysis of aggregate socioeconomic and demographic characteristics from
        census tracts does not inform our understanding of patterns of
        interaction or the character of norms, values, and aspirations in a
        group of people who live together. Nevertheless, the elision has become
        institutionalized in the poverty-research industry, and debate occurs
        now only over which batches of indicators and what thresholds of them
        most satisfactorily mark an underclass area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those laundry lists of characteristics also entail a questionable
        extension of the category “behavior” to phenomena that might only
        indirectly be products of human agency. Female household-heading, for
        example, can result from a number of circumstances entirely beyond the
        control of women whose lives are compressed into that label. The same
        applies to unemployment or underemployment, and even long-term status as
        a welfare recipient can stem completely from impersonal forces.
        Characterizing those phenomena as behavior reveals a zeal for validating
        the underclass concept, and a fundamental inclination to seek the
        sources of poverty in deficiencies of individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
        All versions of the underclass notion center on the behavior of its
        categorical members, though liberals typically hedge with genuflections
        toward the ultimate weight of historical or structural forces. (The
        differences on that score, however, are not great. Conservatives also
        frequently genuflect toward structural pressures and past oppression
        before enunciating one or another brand of tough-love remedy for the
        present.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Why, though, does the underclass idea appeal so powerfully to
        people—including disciplined scholars—even as they must perform
        elaborate, dubious maneuvers to define it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the notion’s popularity is driven by the sociology of the policy
        research community. Technocratic discourse and methods nurture ideas
        that depoliticize the frame for examining social problems. The
        underclass formulation is attractive precisely because it does not exist
        as anyone’s self-description. It is purely a statistical artifact, and
        therefore exclusively the creation and property of its chroniclers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The underclass notion also appeals to several ideological dispositions.
        Most immediately it resonates with the ahistorical individualism rampant
        in the Reagan/Bush/Clinton era. As a corollary, it is attractive to many
        petit bourgeois blacks because it flatters their success by comparison
        and, through the insipid role model rhetoric, allows fawning over the
        allegedly special, tutelary role of the black middle class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of a behaviorally defined underclass also affirms an ensemble
        of racial and class prejudices that lurk beneath an apparently
        innocuous, certainly stupid tendency to reduce the social world to
        aggregates of good people and bad people. Simply, good people are people
        like “us”; bad people are not, and the same behavior is assessed
        differently depending on the category into which the perpetrator falls.
      </p>
      <p>
        An eighteen-year-old drug courier with a monogrammed BMW is
        pathological; an arbitrageur who strays too far onto the wrong side of
        legality is too clever for his own good—the stuff of tragedy. Dependency
        on AFDC breeds sloth and pathology; dependency on military contracts,
        tax abatements, or FHA loans does a patriotic service for the country,
        incubates family values, and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the underclass notion may receive the greatest ideological
        boost from pure sexism. For drug-crazed, lawless black and Hispanic men,
        the companion image is the so-called “cycle of poverty,” which focuses
        on women’s living and reproductive practices as the transmission belt
        that drives the cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rhetoric of “family values,” and of “disorganization,”
        “deterioration,” and “disintegration” stigmatizes female-headed
        households, which now are home to a majority of American children, and
        applies a hierarchy of propriety to the conjugal arrangements within
        which women might give birth. Of the master list of empirical indicators
        of pathology, most are observable only in women.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are already seeing the policy fruit that this imagery bears. A judge
        in Kansas City has ordered children to use their absent fathers’ names,
        presumably to strengthen obligation by establishing ownership. A Kansas
        state legislator has argued that impoverished women should be induced to
        accept Norplant birth-control implants as a way to hold down welfare
        costs and cut the size of the recipient population.
      </p>
      <p>
        State welfare departments have taken up marriage brokering, as in a
        Wisconsin plan to offer cash inducements for women who marry their way
        off AFDC and to cut benefits for “unwed teenage mothers.” These moves
        demonstrate unambiguously the repressive, antifeminist outlook lurking
        beneath the focus on family. (In 1996, this repressive impetus
        culminated in Congress’s passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work
        Opportunity Reconciliation Act, which eliminated AFDC. The Act was
        signed by President Clinton, who boasted that it was the fulfillment of
        his 1992 campaign pledge to “end welfare as we know it.”)
      </p>
      <p class="separator">＊ ＊ ＊</p>
      <p>
        How, then, should we talk about those who are stigmatized as the
        “underclass”? First, it is imperative to reject all assumptions that
        poor people are behaviorally or attitudinally different from the rest of
        American society. Some percentage of <em>all</em> Americans take drugs,
        fight in families, and abuse or neglect children. If the behavior exists
        across lines of class, race, and opportunity, then it cannot reasonably
        be held to produce poverty. If it does not <em>cause</em> poverty,
        therefore, we do not need to focus on it at all in the context of
        policy-oriented discussion about poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
        We should also fight against lurid, exploitative journalism that
        reproduces obnoxious class and racial prejudices. And we should be
        prepared to recognize the extent to which such prejudices infiltrate
        even ostensibly more careful, allegedly sympathetic depictions and
        expose them for what they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Affirmatively, we should insist on returning the focus of the discussion
        of the production and reproduction of poverty to examination of its
        sources in the operations of the American political and economic system.
        Specifically, the discussion should focus on such phenomena as the logic
        of deindustrialization, models of urban redevelopment driven by
        real-estate speculation, the general intensification of polarization of
        wealth, income, and opportunity in American society, the ways in which
        race and gender figure into those dynamics, and, not least, the role of
        public policy in reproducing and legitimating them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, we should fight for policy changes that will open opportunity
        structures: support for improving access to jobs, housing, schooling,
        real drug rehabilitation of the sort available to the relatively
        well-off. A focus on behavior, after all, leads into a blind alley in
        policy terms. If we say that poor people are poor because they have bad
        values, we let government off the hook, even though conscious government
        policy—for example, in the relations between support for metropolitan
        real estate speculation and increasing homelessness, malnutrition, and
        infant mortality—is directly implicated in causing poverty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, with respect to the litany of moral repressiveness that seems
        to be obligatory these days, I want the record to show that I do not
        want to hear another word about drugs or crime without hearing in the
        same breath about decent jobs, adequate housing, and egalitarian
        education.
