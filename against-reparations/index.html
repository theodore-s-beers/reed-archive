        The notion that white America, however defined, owes reparations to
        black Americans for slavery and its legacy has been around for some
        time. Until recently, its most dramatic eruption into public life was in
        1969, when James Forman, the former chairman of the Student Nonviolent
        Coordinating Committee (SNCC), led a protest at New York&#x2019;s
        liberal Riverside Church and presented a &#x201C;Black Manifesto&#x201D;
        that demanded, among other things, $500 million in reparations to black
        Americans from white churches and synagogues. The idea lingered on the
        periphery of the public agenda for a few years. In 1972, Jesse
        Jackson&#x2019;s Operation PUSH and the National Economics Association,
        a black economists&#x2019; group, attempted to reintroduce it around the
        presidential election in conjunction with a demand for a $900 million
        &#x201C;freedom budget.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        For the next two decades, the idea of organizing to demand reparations
        circulated mainly within politically marginal, nationalist circles. It
        did not gain much traction even among black activists.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the last half-dozen years or so, however, the issue has been
        threatening to come in from the margins. Partly stimulated by the
        successful pursuit of compensation for Japanese Americans who were
        interned by the US government during World War II and for victims of
        Nazi slave labor, talk of a movement to demand reparations for black
        Americans has been spreading.
      </p>
      <p>
        I&#x2019;ve watched this with curiosity and bemusement. I imagined that
        the reparations talk would evaporate because it seemed so clearly a
        political dead end. No such luck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Publication of
        <em>The Debt: What America Owes to Blacks</em> (E.&#xA0;P. Dutton, 2000)
        by Randall Robinson, the respected president of TransAfrica, the
        organization that played a central role in the US movement against
        apartheid in South Africa, seems to have propelled the reparations issue
        into the spotlight. Now it seems to be everywhere&#x2014;in special
        features on network television, in mainstream publications like
        <em>Harper&#x2019;s</em> and the <em>New York Times</em>, and all over
        the black-oriented media.
      </p>
      <p>
        How has this happened? And what is its significance? To put it more
        provocatively, how does a project that seems so obviously a nonstarter
        in American politics come to capture so much of the public imagination?
        After all, support for affirmative action has eroded significantly, and
        reparations raises the ante on compensatory policy exponentially. Why
        has this idea attained currency now?
      </p>
      <p>
        Answering these questions requires understanding that the call for
        reparations blends material, symbolic, and psychological components.
      </p>
      <p>
        The material component is the most obvious, since the call for
        reparations responds to the actual harm inflicted on blacks during and
        after slavery. This component includes direct legacies, such as the
        federal government&#x2019;s failure to fulfill the promise of
        Emancipation by adopting the Radical Republican proposals during
        Reconstruction that would have expropriated the plantations in the South
        and divided them among the freed people, thus establishing a black
        yeomanry of independent stakeholders. It also includes the federal
        government&#x2019;s further capitulation to the former slaveholders by
        accepting their disenfranchisement of black voters later in the
        nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As a result, black citizens
        were removed from effective participation in public life. What followed
        was the imposition of the white supremacist regime of official political
        and economic apartheid that reigned in the South for the first
        two-thirds of the twentieth century.
      </p>
      <p>
        The indirect material legacy of slavery includes such explicitly
        discriminatory practices as the Federal Housing Administration&#x2019;s
        enforcement of racially exclusionary &#x201C;restrictive
        covenants&#x201D; in its lending policies officially until 1948 and
        unofficially for some years thereafter. This practice severely
        disadvantaged black people&#x2019;s pursuit of home ownership, the
        principal form of capital accumulation for most Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effects of unequal education, labor market discrimination, and
        publicly initiated and supported ghettoization are further indirect
        material legacies of slavery. We could also include the effects of New
        Deal compromises with Southern Democrats&#x2014;largely racially
        inspired&#x2014;that excluded most black workers from initial coverage
        under Social Security and agricultural assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        That blacks have been systematically disadvantaged as a result of
        slavery and its aftermath there can be no doubt. That is the strength of
        the material case for reparations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The symbolic component of the reparations campaign seems to center on
        public acknowledgment of the injustices inflicted on black people
        historically in this country. On the one hand, this could promote public
        education about the real history of the United States, although that is
        a project that does not require the rhetoric of reparations. On the
        other hand, it fits the Clintonoid tenor of sappy public apologies and
        maudlin psychobabble about collective pain and healing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Robinson, for his part, seems fixated on pursuing racial parity in
        monuments and statuary&#x2014;perhaps a function of his long years in
        Washington, DC, and his growing up in Richmond, Virginia, two cities in
        which the politics of public monuments loom larger than elsewhere. (And
        how much would you like to bet that that&#x2019;s as far as the
        restitution would go? Elites will always prefer symbolic gestures to
        material ones: &#x201C;Let&#x2019;s see, should we give them college
        tuition and affordable housing or a heartfelt apology and a few
        monuments and plaques? Hmmm, which will it be, which will it
        be?&#x201D;)
      </p>
      <p>
        The psychological component, though, is most revealing of the dubious
        politics that undergirds this movement. The demand for reparations is
        held to be important as a means of raising consciousness among black
        people, whether or not it can be won. But consciousness of what? Among
        more populist or radical adherents, this view rests on the
        premise&#x2014;a vestige of the nationalist/anti-imperialist radicalism
        that evolved from Black Power&#x2014;that mobilizing black people to
        fight for a better world requires first rectifying their understanding
        of who they are and where they come from in order to build on the
        principle of racial solidarity. Of course, cultivation of a general
        understanding of history is useful, perhaps necessary, for developing
        and sustaining an insurgent politics, and it&#x2019;s a good thing in
        its own right. However, it&#x2019;s more than questionable that people
        must&#x2014;or even will&#x2014;mobilize around earlier
        generations&#x2019; grievances to pursue current objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        The deeper appeal of reparations talk for its proponents is to create or
        stress a sense of racial peoplehood as the primary basis for political
        identity. This movement&#x2019;s psychological project is grounded on
        two beliefs: first, that rank-and-file black people suffer from an
        improper or defective sense of identity, and second, that an important
        task of political action is to restore or correct racial consciousness
        that the legacy of slavery is supposed to have distorted or destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among some strains of cultural nationalists, this view unabashedly
        reproduces the old &#x201C;damage thesis,&#x201D; which was criticized
        by historian Daryl Michael Scott in his book
        <em
          >Contempt and Pity: Social Policy and the Image of the Damaged Black
          Psyche, 1880&#x2013;1996</em
        >
        (University of North Carolina, 1997). According to this thesis, slavery
        and its aftermath left black Americans without cultural moorings and
        therefore especially vulnerable to various social pathologies. This
        notion has been the foundation of academic and journalistic slanders of
        black poor and working people. It was famously perpetrated by Daniel
        Patrick Moynihan in his scurrilous 1965 report, &#x201C;The Negro
        Family: A Case for National Action,&#x201D; and it underlies
        contemporary notions of a self-destructive black urban underclass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Randall Robinson&#x2019;s argument for pursuit of reparations hinges on
        this view of the black American population&#x2014;lucky
        <em>petit bourgeois</em> people like himself excepted, of
        course&#x2014;as defective and in need of moral and psychological
        repair. The idea resonates with middle-class
        <em>noblesse oblige</em> and a commitment to a racial politics that
        ensconces a particular guiding role for upper class blacks. Those are,
        after all, the people who can conduct the finely calibrated analyses
        that determine what forms and magnitude just compensation should take;
        they are the people who would stand to administer whatever compromise
        palliatives are likely to ensue from this activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the question of compensation opens a plethora of technical problems.
        Should payments go to individuals or to some presumably representative
        corporate entity? If the former, who qualifies as a recipient? Would
        descendants of people who had been enslaved elsewhere (for instance,
        Brazil or the Caribbean) be eligible? And what of those no longer
        legally black people with slave ancestors?
      </p>
      <p>
        As a friend of mine has suggested, these issues could produce a lively
        trade for genealogists, DNA testers, and other such quacks, and already
        some seem to be rising to the opportunity. These ambiguities, moreover,
        expose the faultiness of comparisons to payments to victims of Japanese
        internment and Nazi slave labor camps, who were identifiable individuals
        whose experience of the ultimate injustice was direct.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the recipient is to be some corporate entity, as Robinson and others
        suggest, how can its representativeness and accountability be
        determined? If the body is a development fund, who would control it and
        how would the decision be made? Robinson has suggested that
        philanthropic agencies be the grantees, but which ones and to whom would
        they be accountable? This talk&#x2014;as is standard in contemporary
        black politics&#x2014;presumes a coherent, knowable black agenda that
        can be determined outside of democratic, participatory processes among
        those in whose names decisions are to be made and resources allocated.
      </p>
      <p>
        What strikes me as most incomprehensible about the reparations movement
        is its complete disregard for the simplest, most mundanely pragmatic
        question about any political mobilization: How can we imagine building a
        political force that would enable us to prevail on this issue?
      </p>
      <p>
        But the question ultimately does not arise because reparations talk is
        rooted in a different kind of politics, a politics of elite-brokerage
        and entreaty to the ruling class and its official conscience, the
        philanthropic foundations, for racial side-payments. &#x201C;Until
        America&#x2019;s white ruling class accepts the fact that the book never
        closes on massive unredressed social wrongs, America can have no future
        as one people,&#x201D; Robinson writes. Lest there be any doubt about
        the limited social vision that makes such an entreaty plausible, he
        brushes away the deepest foundations of American inequality:
        &#x201C;Lamentably, there will always be poverty.&#x201D; His beef is
        that black Americans are statistically overrepresented at the bottom.
        This is a protest politics that depends on the good will of those who
        hold power. By definition, it is not equipped to challenge existing
        relations of power and distribution other than marginally, with token
        gestures.
      </p>
      <p>
        There&#x2019;s a more insidious dynamic at work in this politics as
        well, which helps us understand why the reparations idea suddenly has
        spread so widely through mainstream political discourse. We are in one
        of those rare moments in American history&#x2014;like the 1880s and
        1890s and the Great Depression&#x2014;when common circumstances of
        economic and social insecurity have strengthened the potential for
        building broad solidarity across race, gender, and other identities
        around shared concerns of daily life. These are concerns that only the
        minority of comfortable and well-off can dismiss in favor of monuments
        and apologies and a politics of psychobabble&#x2014;concerns like access
        to quality health care, the right to a decent and dignified livelihood,
        affordable housing, quality education for all. They can be pursued
        effectively only by struggling to unite a wide section of the American
        population that is denied those essential social benefits or lives in
        fear of losing them. Isn&#x2019;t it interesting that at such a moment
        the corporate-dominated, opinion-shaping media discover and project a
        demand for racially defined reparations that cuts precisely against
        building such solidarity?
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that many activists who have taken up the cause of reparations
        otherwise hold a politics quite at odds with the limitations that
        I&#x2019;ve described here. To some extent, I suspect their involvement
        stems from an old reflex of attempting to locate a progressive kernel in
        the nationalist sensibility. It certainly is an expression of a
        generally admirable commitment to go where people seem to be moving.
      </p>
      <p>But we must ask: Where can this motion go?</p>
