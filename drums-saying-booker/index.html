        In a typical episode of <em>Ramar of the Jungle</em>, an early
        television adventure series, the two heroes of the show spend most of
        their time on safari, attended to by a coterie of native bearers.
        Whenever they hear drums in the distance, the whites summon their head
        bearer. “Willie, what are the drums saying?” Willie, a Sancho Panza-like
        servant, steps forward. “Bwana, drums say simba come soon, much danger.”
        On noticing a furtive sullenness among the bearers, the hero again
        inquires: “Willie, what’s going on with the men?” Willie answers
        dutifully. “Men afraid. Say they don’t want to go into Leopard Men
        territory, afraid of evil spirits.”
      </p>
      <p>
        In these vignettes, Willie was enacting the definitive role of the black
        public intellectual—interpreting the opaquely black heart of darkness
        for whites. Of course, this connection couldn’t be observed at the time
        because the category “black public intellectual” didn’t yet exist. It
        wasn’t invented until nearly four decades later, when several youngish
        black professors with ties to and visibility within the cultural
        studies/cultural politics precincts of the academic left began using it
        to refer to themselves and one another. This group includes most
        prominently Cornel West, Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Gloria Watkins (bell
        hooks), Michael Dyson, and Robin Kelley, though others in that world no
        doubt feel comfortable wearing the label. And people with varying
        professional and political affiliations—like Stanley Crouch, Stephen
        Carter, and Shelby Steele—increasingly turn up under the black public
        intellectual rubric, as the Warholian imperatives of fame send it
        rippling through the culture. But this identity is most clearly the
        product of the cultural wing of the left academy and its extramural
        offshoots.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last months of 1994 and early 1995, the notion gained greater
        currency. It has been addressed in successive articles by Michael Alan
        Bérubé in the <em>New Yorker</em> and Robert Boynton in the
        <em>Atlantic</em>, while Leon Wieseltier’s right-for-the-wrong-reasons
        attack on Cornel West in the <em>New Republic</em> spawned commentary by
        James Ledbetter and Ellen Willis in the <em>Voice</em>. Although these
        white writers obviously didn’t invent the black public intellectual
        identity, they certainly anointed it as a specific, notable status in
        upper-middle-brow American culture. Despite gestures in the direction of
        serious critical analysis, the Bérubé and Boynton essays are really
        press releases. Their explorations of their subjects’ substantive output
        are thin and breezy. And I’m certain that not all of the individuals on
        Boynton’s rather ecumenical list—the criterion for which seems to be
        “black people who write social commentary and are known to white elite
        institutions”—would embrace the black public intellectual label. But now
        that the concept has been formalized as a social type, it is useful to
        consider exactly what this phenomenon is, where it came from, and what
        it means.
      </p>
      <p>
        The “public intellectual” notion emerged in 1987, when Russell Jacoby
        published <em>The Last Intellectuals</em>, which was in part a nostalgic
        exaltation of a previous cohort of politically engaged writers and
        critics. Jacoby contended that public intellectuals such as Dwight
        MacDonald, Irving Howe, Philip Rahv, and others were only marginally
        tied to the academy, and that their freedom from institutional
        constraint enabled them to fashion an autonomous, macroscopic view of
        American society and culture. The cohort of black people who call
        themselves black public intellectuals seem to suggest that they
        constitute a new social and political identity. But on closer
        examination, the role is all too familiar.
      </p>
      <p class="separator">＊ ＊ ＊</p>
      <p>
        We might see today’s black public intellectuals as lineal descendants of
        the authors of nineteenth-century slave narratives, if we understand
        those narratives as attempts to articulate a collective racial voice.
        The major difference is that slave narrators—with the partial exception
        of Frederick Douglass—did not attain celebrity as individuals. Rather,
        their public significance lay in embodying black people’s collective
        capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The role of cellular representative reflected the prevailing view that a
        race’s ideals are carried by its exceptional members. Personal
        attainment was less meaningful as a statement about the worth or prowess
        of the narrator than as a vindication of black humanity. Even the most
        accomplished authors or those whose odysseys had been most arduous or
        led to the greatest triumphs did not develop intensely
        <em>personal</em> followings. They remained primarily data points
        attesting to black possibility, and cogs in a larger abolitionist
        conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The black public intellectual’s more direct progenitor is Booker T.
        Washington, who turned the slave narrative into a saga of personal
        triumph befitting his era. In <em>Up from Slavery</em> (1901) Washington
        constructed a program and a rhetoric that promised group progress
        through acquiescence to white supremacy. He crafted it in the idiom of
        the gospel of personal enrichment then popular in both religious and
        secular (and often overlapping) forms. In presenting his tale of
        individual and group success through strength of character and
        perseverance, he simultaneously presented himself as a Horatio Alger
        figure and an Andrew Carnegie dipped in chocolate.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than Douglass ever had been, Washington became the singular,
        trusted informant to communicate to whites what the Negro thought, felt,
        wanted, needed. Washington’s stature derived from skill at soothing
        white liberals’ <em>retreat</em> from the Reconstruction era’s
        relatively progressive racial politics. He became the first purely
        freelance race spokesman; his status depended on designation by white
        elites rather than by any black electorate or social movement. To that
        extent he originated a new model of the generic Black Leader—the Racial
        Voice accountable to no clearly identifiable constituency among the
        spoken-for.
      </p>
      <p>
        What made this possible, and credible, was black Americans’ expulsion
        from civic life. The role was unthinkable, even for a figure as
        prominent and respected as Douglass, during the first three decades
        after the Civil War because a culture of broad, democratic political
        participation flourished among black citizens. The obvious multiplicity
        of articulate black voices, from the local Union Leagues and Loyal
        Leagues to the United States Congress, would have immediately exposed as
        absurd the suggestion that any individual carried—or should carry—a
        blanket racial proxy. The idea of the free-floating race spokesman was a
        pathological effect of the disfranchisement specific to the segregation
        era, the condition to which Washington contributed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Washington’s paramountcy as bearer of the race’s interests was always
        contested by other blacks, and no one claimed the mantle after him. In
        fact the fifty years between his death in 1915 and the final defeat of
        the Jim Crow regime were punctuated by periods of intense, politically
        engaged debate among black intellectuals. In addition to the famously
        vibrant discursive community of the 1920s, a lively current of engaged
        scholarship and commentary ran through the 1930s and 1940s, centered
        institutionally in the <em>Journal of Negro History</em>, the
        <em>Journal of Negro Education</em>, and Du Bois’s <em>Phylon</em>.
        Participants in this community—which included humanists such as Sterling
        Brown, Jessie Fauset, Zora Neale Hurston, James Weldon Johnson, and John
        S. Lash, as well as such social scientists as Abram Harris, Charles S.
        Johnson, and Joseph Sandy Himes (novelist Chester’s brother)—converged
        on such questions as the definition, status, and functions of black
        literature, the foundation of black identity, topical critiques of
        ideological programs and tendencies in social affairs, and the character
        and obligations of Afro-Americanist intellectual activity itself. Many,
        such as Ralph Bunche, E. Franklin Frazier, Doxey Wilkerson, and Oliver
        Cox, operated simultaneously in academic and activist domains. Others,
        like James Ford, A. Philip Randolph, and George Schuyler, functioned
        entirely outside the academy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cold War anti-radicalism and the apparent successes of an atheoretical,
        desegregationist politics narrowed the scope and blunted the critical
        edge of black intellectual discourse in the 1950s, although Baldwin and
        Ellison pushed against the boundaries of convention. And civil rights
        activism soon created its own eddies of debate and commentary. From the
        mid-1960s to the late 1970s another wave of engaged political and
        cultural critique defined black intellectual life; this movement was
        sustained most visibly in the <em>Negro Digest</em> (later
        <em>Black World</em>) and the <em>Black Scholar</em>, but it was
        propelled as much through ephemeral, <em>samizdat</em>-like writing (for
        example, Amiri Baraka’s paper, “Why I Changed My Ideology”). More
        directly tied to activist politics, this pattern of debate was more
        sharply contentious and aggressively oppositional (and perhaps less
        sophisticated) than that of the interwar years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of these discursive moments, however, was haunted by the problem of
        speaking for the race—how to delineate the characteristics and warrants
        of black leadership, how to authenticate it, the difficulties associated
        with assuming the racial voice, the conundrum of undertaking social or
        cultural criticism without accepting the role of race spokesperson.
        Bunche and Cox tried to generate a rigorous critique of prevailing
        styles of political leadership. Baldwin and Ellison strained mightily to
        comment on topical issues in a racially conscious way while rejecting
        designation as black spokesmen. All these concerns are responses to the
        conventional presumption—Washington’s unacknowledged legacy in the
        modern era—that any black individual’s participation in public life
        always strives to express the will of the racial collectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This presumption in turn reflects an important complication facing black
        intellectuals; they need to address both black and white audiences, and
        those different acts of communication proceed from objectives that are
        distinct and often incompatible. James Weldon Johnson identified this
        peculiar burden in a 1928 essay, “The Dilemma of the Negro Author,”
        noting that black writers face “more than a double audience; it is a
        divided audience made up of two elements with differing and often quite
        opposite and antagonistic points of view.” Although Johnson focused
        primarily on creative writing, his observation that the white audience’s
        biases dispose black authors toward a “defensive and exculpatory
        literature” applies more generally. The historian Lawrence D. Reddick
        and the philosopher William T. Fontaine in the ’30s and ’40s similarly
        complained of the “defense psychology” of black scholars, maintaining
        that it undermines examination of the black experience by grounding
        Afro-Americanist inquiry in the narrow, other-directed objective of
        demonstrating black people’s equal humanity.
      </p>
      <p class="separator">＊ ＊ ＊</p>
      <p>
        Those who now describe themselves as black public intellectuals diverge
        significantly from the rich history of black commentary. Their
        differences speak to the character of our time and the changes in black
        intellectual life ensuing from the passage of the segregation era. The
        contemporary public intellectuals are unique in that they exhibit little
        sense of debate or controversy among themselves as a cohort. To the
        contrary, they seem rather to come together as a publicist’s delight, a
        hyperbolically log-rolling lovefest. Watkins and West gush over each
        other’s nonpareil brilliance; Gates proclaims West “the preeminent
        African-American intellectual of our generation”; and Gates, West, and
        Kelley lavish world-historical superlatives on Dyson, who, naturally
        enough, expresses comparable judgments about them. Their anthologies and
        conferences feature no sharp disagreements. Instead, they function as a
        kind of Tuskegee Machine by committee. Their political utterances exude
        <em>pro forma</em> moralism, not passion. Their critiques are only easy
        pronouncements against racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-Semitism or
        equally easy dissent from a lame Afrocentricity that has no adherents
        among their audience anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point is not that controversy by itself makes for purity or
        legitimacy, but that in this instance at least, the absence of
        controversy betrays a lack of critical content and purpose. The stance
        of these black public intellectuals is by and large just that—not a
        stand but a posture. Can the reader familiar with their work recall
        without hesitation a specific critique, a concrete formulation—an
        extended argument that is neither airily abstract nor cozily compatible
        with what passes for common sense at the moment? I’d bet not, because in
        this arena prominence of author counts more than weight of utterance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The posture of the black public intellectual is a claim to speak from
        the edges of convention, to infuse mainstream discourse with a
        particular “counterhegemonic” perspective at least implicitly linked to
        one’s connectedness to identifiably black sensibilities or interests. It
        is also therefore, again at least implicitly, a claim to immersion in a
        strategic conversation among black Americans about politics, culture,
        and social affairs. The posture is flimflam that elides the dual
        audience problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        To expand on Johnson’s initial formulation, for the black audience the
        focus of critical intellectual activity is—or should be—on careful,
        tough-minded examination of the multifarious dynamics shaping black
        social life. To that extent, the black intellectual positions herself
        metaphorically at the boundary of the black experience and faces in,
        establishing enough distance to get a broad perspective but intent on
        contributing to a conversation that presumes not only intricate
        knowledge but also an interpretive orientation filtered through shared,
        racially inflected assumptions that inform strategic thinking. The
        racially and politically attentive black intellectual is in this sense
        engaged in a discourse of group self-examination.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addressing the white audience, the task remains all too much
        explaining the mysteries of black America. For that project one still
        positions oneself on the metaphorical boundary of the Bantustan, but
        facing outward. This is why there isn’t much attention to flux,
        differentiation, contingency, or even analysis of social process in our
        public intellectuals’ accounts of black life; you don’t see nuances with
        your back turned, and besides that sort of messy texture doesn’t count
        for much because the white audience mainly just wants the executive
        summary anyway. Why do they act that way? How can I keep from
        gratuitously offending my coworkers or housekeeper? What do the drums
        say, Cornel?
      </p>
      <p>
        The different objectives involved in addressing the two audiences become
        more important in the post-Jim Crow world. The demise of
        <em>Black World</em> and atrophy of the <em>Black Scholar</em> both fuel
        and reflect the shriveling of an autonomous domain for black debate. At
        the same time, the opening-up of employment opportunities at elite
        academic institutions has increased the likelihood that black
        intellectuals operate in multiracial discursive networks and has greatly
        enhanced the visibility of a lucky few. Therefore, white forums,
        particularly those associated with the left, have become the primary
        arenas for elaboration of black commentary and critical public
        discourse, which makes a principled self-consciousness in negotiating
        the two audiences all the more essential. But the discursive space
        constructed by the black public intellectuals either conflates the
        audiences into an unhelpful least common denominator or undertakes a
        misdirection in combining an insider’s “it’s a black thang” posture with
        a superficial, other-directed analysis explaining or defending the
        Negro. The result is an all-purpose message, equally suitable for
        corporate boards, rarefied academic conferences, White House dinners,
        and common folk. And, unsurprisingly, the white audience overwhelms and
        sets the terms for the black, repeating an ironic pattern begun with
        Washington.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally, engaged black intellectuals have also addressed a third
        audience—a transracial community of progressive activists. This is a
        pattern that can be seen from the abolitionist Douglass through the
        middle-aged and elderly Du Bois, the young Bunche and others in his
        cohort, down to Lani Guinier, Julian Bond, and hosts of others less well
        known. They haven’t functioned as interpreters of an esoteric black
        experience or bearers of a “black position” or as itinerant Moral
        Voices, but as participants in a common debate aimed at stimulating,
        directing, and taking political action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where Baldwin and Ellison bristled at the Black Voice designation,
        today’s public intellectuals accept it gladly. And they have to, because
        maintaining credibility with their real, white audience requires that
        they be authentically black, that their reports on the heart of darkness
        ring with verisimilitude. (“Drums say nihilism, moral breakdown. Need
        politics of conversion, love ethic.”) This underscores the extent to
        which—beneath all the overheated academic trendiness—the black public
        intellectual stance merely updates Booker T. Washington’s role, but
        without the institutional trappings and, for the moment at least,
        without the power.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with Washington, the public intellectual’s authenticity is conferred
        by white opinion-makers. The typical trajectory of stardom is
        instructive. First, one becomes recognized as a Black Voice in the
        intellectual apparatus of the left, which—out of a combination of good
        intentions and bad faith—stands ever ready to confer prominence on any
        reasonable, articulate black person willing to associate with it. To
        qualify, one need not even put forward a critique that seems leftist by
        usual standards: secular, rooted in political economy, focused on
        stimulating political mobilization. After all, the “black community” is
        different, has different needs, <em>etc</em>. Reputation spreads, and
        eventually opportunities present themselves to cross over from the left
        intellectual ghetto to the status of Black Voice for the mainstream. All
        it takes is the courage to square off in the white public sphere against
        black anti-Semitism on the Anti-Defamation League’s terms, or to join
        the chorus lamenting the putative social pathology of the inner city.
        Not to mention a knack for packaging the center-right wisdom of the
        moment as a well-considered, yet bold and personally risky challenge to
        convention. This is the path blazed so far by Gates and West, and Dyson,
        as usual, is bringing his best Pigmeat-Markham-Meets-Baudrillard act
        along behind.
      </p>
      <p class="separator">＊ ＊ ＊</p>
      <p>
        The consummate irony of the puffery is that it is misdirected all the
        way through. Jacoby’s archetype is only weakly connected to the
        bureaucratized intellectual life of the academy. His public intellectual
        figures in a critique of the politically corrosive effects of the left’s
        having settled into the university after the collapse of extramural
        radicalism. But those now wearing the black public intellectual tag as a
        red, black, and green badge of courage are not only deeply embedded in
        the higher reaches of the academic celebrity system, they are also its
        unalloyed products. This brute fact is obscured by another flimflam—what
        we might call the Proudhon Scam. Marx quipped that the anarchist
        Pierre-Joseph Proudhon represented himself in Germany, where they didn’t
        know much political economy, as a political economist; and in France,
        where they didn’t know much philosophy, as a philosopher. West, Dyson
        <em>et al</em>. use the public intellectual pose to claim authority both
        as certified, world-class elite academics and as links to an
        extra-academic blackness, thus splitting the difference between being
        insiders and outsiders. In the process, they are able to skirt the
        practical requirements of either role—to avoid both rigorous, careful
        intellectual work <em>and</em> protracted, committed political action.

        Gates is the most complicated, most intellectually probing, and most
        consistent of the group. Unlike the others, he makes no pretense of
        being a conduit to some sort of grassroots black authenticity. He has
        publicly criticized the notion that there are leaders who are singular
        representatives of the race. His position is perhaps most like that of
        Bayard Rustin, as a freelance advocate for black political centrism.
        Like Rustin, Gates has without equivocation chosen as the forum for his
        advocacy the largely white circles of elite opinion, most conspicuously
        as a staff writer for the <em>New Yorker</em>. A significant difference
        is that Rustin in his last years was primarily an arbiter of the
        boundaries of “responsible” black spokesmanship for the right wing of
        the Democratic Party coalition. Gates also sometimes functions as an
        arbiter of black political etiquette, but he is more actively concerned
        with articulating the voice of an autonomously black, self-consciously
        <em>petit-bourgeois</em> centrism.

        West’s program is less coherent and less concrete than Gates’s. He has
        postured as a link to black activist authenticity, holding an honorary
        leadership position in the Democratic Socialists of America and
        referring frequently to associations with supposed grassroots leaders
        and organizations. At the same time, he has no particular history of
        concrete political practice or affiliation and has shown no reticence
        about operating as a freelance race relations consultant and Moral Voice
        for white elites. Most of all, the substance of his public
        commentary—when it descends from sonorous platitudes and well-hedged
        abstractions—is, to resuscitate an old slogan, “left in form, right in
        essence.” As Stephen Steinberg has demonstrated in a thorough and
        powerful critique in the summer 1994 issue of <em>New Politics</em>,
        West’s interpretation of contemporary social and political life derives
        directly and definitively from Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s scurrilous
        arguments about black pathology.

        Kelley’s <em>Hammer and Hoe</em> (1990), about black communists in 1930s
        Alabama, is a credible piece of scholarship. But too often with Kelley,
        politics reduces to the academic pose, the combined stance of acting out
        flamboyantly crafted rituals of “blackness” in conventional settings and
        spinning narratives that ultimately demean concerted political action by
        claiming to find it everywhere. Dyson and Watkins/hooks are little more
        than hustlers, blending bombast, clichés, psychobabble, and lame
        guilt-tripping in service to the “pay me” principle. Dyson, for
        instance, has managed to say absolutely nothing in a string of
        <em>New York Times</em> op-ed pieces.

        “Public intellectual” is by and large an excuse, the marker of a
        sterile, hybrid variant of “bearing witness” that, when all is said and
        done, is a justification for an aversion to intellectual or political
        heavy lifting—a pretentious name for highfalutin babble about the movie
        you just saw or the rhyme you just heard on the radio. In its
        intimations of always being from and on the way to the other place, the
        label is an admission and exaltation of <em>dis</em>connectedness, a
        notion of the critical intellectual as Galahad or High Plains Drifter
        that is the opposite of rootedness in a discourse community. That is why
        this cohort’s discussions of themselves and others seem so much like
        attempts to create all-star lineups—the greatest this, the most
        brilliant that, the preeminent other. They’re more like the Super
        Friends than the Frankfurt School or the Howard University social
        scientists of the 1930s.

        There’s a lot about this charade that is distasteful, but one feature
        makes it especially hard to take. The dialectics of authentication
        trades on elaborate displays of what sociolinguists call
        code-switching—in this case, going back and forth from rarefied
        theoreticism to slivers of one or another version of black vernacular
        expression. In academic lectures and scholarly writing, Kelley can “send
        a shout out” in the <em>Journal of American History</em> while dragging
        Gramsci to the root doctor and holy roller church. Dyson finds Michael
        Jackson’s “postmodern spirituality” and in lectures lacks only for cork;
        West loads up on Continental theory to explain why the music he listened
        to in his undergraduate dorm is the apotheosis of black culture and why
        poor people need moral rearmament. When we consider that these
        performances are directed to white audiences, their minstrel quality
        stands out as especially distasteful because it masquerades as being in
        touch with the latest wrinkles of refined black hipness. This,
        admittedly, puts off those affronted by coon shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        More significantly, the public intellectuals’ style has baleful effects
        on the scholarly examination of black American life. In rejecting all
        considerations of standards of evidence and argument as expressions of
        naïve positivism, the cultural politicians get to make the story up as
        they go along. Graduate students can figure out that this gambit has two
        very attractive features: it drastically reduces the quantity of digging
        and thinking one has to do, and it clears the path to public visibility
        and academic recognition. Of course, it’s not as if black public
        intellectuals were the only hustlers in an academic world largely
        defined by the politics of reputation; and all in all it’s good that
        black people are getting paid, too. So why should anyone be concerned?
        The answer is that the public intellectuals cohere around a more or less
        deceptively conservative politics that is particularly dangerous at this
        moment in our history.
      </p>
      <p>
        Political conservatism is fundamental to the Black Voice business now no
        less than in 1895, and Stanley Crouch and Shelby Steele have shown that
        it is sometimes the sole requirement. One can qualify for the job only
        by giving white opinion-makers a heavy dose of what they want to hear.
        Gates didn’t get to be a world-class Black Voice until he denounced the
        bogey of “black anti-Semitism” all over the op-ed page of the
        <em>New York Times</em> and went on to reassure <em>Forbes</em>’s
        readership that, “yes, there is a culture of poverty,” calling up the
        image of a “sixteen-year-old mother, a thirty-two-year-old grandmother
        and a forty-eight-year-old great-grandmother,” noting for good measure,
        “It’s also true that not everyone in any society wants to work, that not
        all people are equally motivated. There! Was that so hard to say?” He
        has since secured his public intellectuality in a series of essays in
        the <em>New Republic</em> and elsewhere whose main point is to endorse
        the “vital center,” and he extols the lost Jim Crow world in
        <em>Colored People</em>, a memoir that could have been titled
        <em>Up from Slavery on Lake Wobegon</em>. West’s conservative moralism
        and victim-blaming have made him Bill Bradley’s favorite conduit to the
        Mind of the Negro and a hit on the business school lecture circuit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most insidious, though, is the retrograde sham that masquerades as a
        leftist “cultural politics.” Rather than an alternative, deep structural
        “infra” politics, as Kelley and others contend, the cultural politics
        focus is a quietistic alternative to real political analysis. It boils
        down to nothing more than an insistence that authentic, meaningful
        political engagement for black Americans is expressed not in relation to
        the institutions of public authority—the state—or the workplace—but in
        the clandestine significance assigned to apparently apolitical rituals.
        Black people, according to this logic, don’t mobilize through overt
        collective action. They do it surreptitiously when they look like
        they’re just dancing, or as a colleague of mine ironically described it,
        “dressing for resistance.” In a
        <em>Journal of American History</em> article, supposedly about black
        working-class opposition, Kelley asks rhetorically: “If a worker turns
        to a root doctor or prayer rather than to a labor union to make an
        employer less evil, is that ‘false consciousness’?” He compares a
        conjuror’s power favorably to that of the CIO, the Populists, and the
        NAACP.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is don’t-worry, be-happy politics. Resistance flows from life by
        definition. There is no need to try to create it because it’s all around
        us; all we have to do is change the way we define things. Then we can
        just celebrate the people’s spontaneous infrapolitics and show white
        people how to find it and point out to them that Gramscianism is an
        African survival. We can make radical politics by climbing the tenure
        ladder and feeling good about our collective black selves through the
        pride of vicarious identification with the embedded theoretical
        sophistication of the folk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worst of all, though, the black public intellectual stance derives from
        and presumes a condition of political demobilization. And for good
        reason. The posture of the Racial Voice requires—and, as the centennial
        of Washington’s perfidy should remind us, helps to produce—a black
        population that is disfranchised and incapable of articulating its own
        agendas as a citizenry. Thus the black intellectuals’ insistence on
        defining politics centered in the exercise of state power as
        inauthentic, which in turn underwrites all the Aesopian interpretive
        twaddle in black cultural studies. (Interestingly, in chastising
        proponents of codes prohibiting hate speech, Gates has complained
        self-righteously about an identity politics that pays no attention to
        public policy. His point would go down better if it came with a little
        self-criticism from one whose scholarly reputation—supposedly the source
        of his prominence—is based on precisely the view that he disparages.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Before disfranchisement in the South, black people didn’t have to
        express their politics surreptitiously; they crafted and fought to
        realize their agendas through public policy, and after disfranchisement
        they fought for sixty years to be reenfranchised so they could do it
        again. And the record of overt black political action outside the South
        is unbroken. What the current environment demands from black
        intellectuals who would comment on public affairs is not more whining
        about disparagement of the “black body” in Western culture (as if that
        were news) or examination of representations of representations or
        noodling about how, if we apply the right spin, everything black people
        do is resistance to oppression. And most of all there is no need for
        interpretations that presume an uncomplicated, conveniently mute black
        reality; there’s already a surfeit of analysis propelled by the
        collective black subject—“black people want, feel, <em>etc</em>.” As is
        true on the left generally, what is desperately called for is
        stimulation of informed discussion among black Americans, and between
        blacks and others, that presumes proprietorship of the institutions of
        governance and policy processes on an identical basis with other
        citizens and aims at crafting agendas that define and realize black
        interests accordingly. We should be in the forefront of the fight
        against ratification of the balanced budget amendment, crafting
        responses to so-called tort reform, fighting corporate globalization,
        and finding ways to counter the assault on the Bill of Rights.

        The cultural politicians’ fixation on youth definitively illustrates
        their bankruptcy. Not only are young people the least connected, the
        most alienated, and the least politically attentive cohort of the black
        population, they’re also the ones whites are most interested in.
        “Willie, why do they have those welfare babies? What must we do so that
        they won’t take my car stereo?” What a felicitous coincidence.
