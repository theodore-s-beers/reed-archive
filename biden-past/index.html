      <p>
        After much huffing and puffing, Joe Biden has officially entered the
        race for 2020. In his announcement, he indicated his intention to hit
        the ground running immediately in early primary states, especially South
        Carolina.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were struck by the emphasis on South Carolina. The state’s Democratic
        presidential primary has taken on iconic status at least since 2008,
        when candidate Barack Obama’s victory there, on the heels of a victory
        in the Iowa caucuses three weeks earlier, propelled him toward the
        nomination. In 2016, South Carolina stood out among the commentariat as
        the crucial test of a candidates’ ability to appeal to African American
        voters, and Hillary Clinton’s overwhelming win fueled the contention
        that she was a much stronger candidate than Senator Bernie Sanders among
        African Americans and other voters of color.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, as the political scientist Cedric Johnson
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/02/sanders-clinton-south-carolina-primary-black-voters-firewall/"
          >makes clear</a
        >, black South Carolinians voted as they did in 2016 for a variety of
        reasons that couldn’t be reduced simply to attraction or loyalty to
        Clinton. Black voters, he stressed, are as complex and diverse as any
        others. He points out that some South Carolina black Democrats were
        primarily motivated by fear of a Trump presidency, which he notes could
        have been especially strong in that state. Many believed that Clinton
        may have been the more familiar, safer choice and responded to
        mobilization by the Clinton firewall in the state party. Others
        responded to the Clinton campaign’s red-baiting of Sanders. And those
        reasons were not mutually exclusive. Johnson’s view was borne out by our
        experience, as we both worked with the Sanders campaign in the state and
        talked with many African American voters and political leaders.
      </p>
      <p>
        An unrecognized irony of the South Carolina primary’s current importance
        as a gauge of African American support is that it and other southern
        primaries figured prominently in the late 1980s and 1990s strategy of
        the conservative, pro-business Democratic Leadership Council—of which
        Biden was a member—to pull the party to the right by appealing to
        conservative white southern men, in part through stigmatizing and
        scapegoating poor African Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Biden was one of the lustiest practitioners of that tactic. In fact,
        that’s what often underlies Biden’s boasts about his talent for
        “reaching across the aisle.” In 1984, he joined with South Carolina’s
        arch-racist Strom Thurmond to sponsor the Comprehensive Crime Control
        Act, which eliminated parole for federal prisoners and limited the
        amount of time sentences could be reduced for good behavior. He and
        Thurmond joined hands to push 1986 and 1988 drug enforcement legislation
        that created the nefarious sentencing disparity between crack and powder
        cocaine as well as other draconian measures that implicate him as one of
        the initiators of what became mass incarceration. (Making political hay
        from racial scapegoating was nothing new for Biden; he’d earned sharp
        criticism from both the NAACP and ACLU in the 1970s for his aggressive
        opposition to school bussing as a tool for achieving school
        desegregation.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Joe Biden was also an enthusiastic supporter of the 1996 welfare
        “reform” that ended the federal government’s 60-year commitment to
        direct provision of aid to poor and indigent people. Instead, his tender
        mercies have been reserved for the banking and credit card industries.
        He has a record that goes back to 1978 of consistently working to make
        it more difficult for poor and working people to declare bankruptcy. And
        he actively supported the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that repealed the
        New Deal-era Glass-Steagall Act, which separated commercial and
        investment banking. The result was to give commercial bankers access to
        depositors’ money and intensify the wild financial speculation that
        culminated in the Great Recession.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, despite his cultivation of a working-stiff image, Biden has a
        long history of willingness to
        <a

          >cut Social Security and Medicare</a
        >
        in the interest of “bipartisan compromise.” And, notwithstanding his
        photo-ops on picket lines and with union leaders, it’s more telling that
        he kicked off his fundraising effort with a $2,800-a-plate event hosted
        by cable giant Comcast’s executive president and including Steven Cozen
        of the

        Biden’s history regarding women and gender issues is as checkered as his
        record on race. As clueless and distasteful as his history of smarmy
        dealings with individual women is, his public record is worse. On
        reproductive freedom, through the 1970s he was openly anti-abortion and,
        as
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://harpers.org/archive/2019/03/joe-biden-record/"
          >Andrew Cockburn reports</a
        >
        in a fine Harper’s article, asserted in a 1974 interview that he felt
        that Roe v Wade “went too far” and that he didn’t think “a woman has the
        sole right to say what should happen to her body.” He supported the Hyde
        amendment, which denied federal funding for abortions and opposed the
        use of US foreign aid for abortion research.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, his most conspicuous affront to women was his role as chair
        of the Senate judiciary committee in condoning committee members’ vile
        and viciously sexist attacks on Anita Hill when she came forward to
        testify against the supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas. He then
        abruptly adjourned the hearing while two other female former employees
        of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under Thomas were waiting
        to give testimony corroborating Hill’s allegations; Biden thus assured
        confirmation of one of the worst, most dangerously conservative supreme
        court appointees of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to Biden’s disturbing record on domestic policy, he has been
        a consistent warmonger. He has supported every military intervention
        he’s been able to, including, most disastrously voting for the 2002
        resolution authorizing war against Iraq and ushering the country into
        the endless war against “terror” we remain immersed in.
      </p>
      <p>
        As times have changed, Biden has expressed retrospective misgivings
        about some of those earlier actions and stances. For example, he very
        recently attempted to offer an apology of sorts,
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/27/jor-biden-anita-hill-clarence-thomas-1991-hearings"
          >more like an unpology, to Anita Hill</a
        >, which she quite understandably rejected. And he remains a pure,
        dyed-in-the-wool neoliberal, as much as ever a tool of Wall Street and
        corporations. We deserve better than a candidate who wants us to look
        past his record and focus only on the image he wants to project and,
        when that tack fails, can offer progressives only a “my bad.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, there is such a candidate in this race. Bernie Sanders has
        consistently and resolutely opposed every one of those racist, sexist,
        anti-worker and jingoist initiatives Biden has supported. And he offers
        a clear, unambiguous vision for an America governed by and in the
        interest of working people and grounded fundamentally on commitments to
        social, racial and gender justice. And that’s an important contrast to
        keep in mind as we move forward in South Carolina and all over the
        country.
