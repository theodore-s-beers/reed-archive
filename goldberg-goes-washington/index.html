        I was expecting pushback from liberals after
        <em>Harper&#x2019;s</em> published my essay &#x201C;<a

          >the <em>Nation</em></a
        >
        as &#x201C;electoral nihilism&#x201D; is totally out-to-lunch.
      </p>
      <p>
        There&#x2019;s a vast gulf between &#x201C;elections don&#x2019;t
        matter&#x201D; and &#x201C;shut up and line up behind this
        season&#x2019;s Democrat.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        For the record, I don&#x2019;t argue for backing third-party
        candidacies, which as a rule are quixotic, and I agree with Goldberg
        that in any given election it&#x2019;s overwhelmingly likely to be true
        that the only realistic choice is to vote for whichever Democrat is
        running. So her beef on that score is with someone else, not me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do argue that it&#x2019;s a serious mistake to exaggerate what
        we&#x2019;re doing when we vote for them and that that practice has come
        back to haunt us since Clinton at least. As only one small illustration,
        where has the American antiwar movement been since November 2008, even
        as President Obama has expanded the theaters of American military
        intervention? My vote for Nader in 2000, by the way, stemmed mainly from
        the right-tilting campaign Gore ran, which was embodied in his selection
        of reactionary tool Joe Lieberman as his running mate. (And I&#x2019;m
        still proud to say that I&#x2019;ve never voted for Lieberman for
        anything.)
      </p>
      <p>
        As I point out in the <em>Harper&#x2019;s</em> article, recalling
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFBl0fnMUVc"
          >Gore&#x2019;s bellicosity</a
        >
        toward Iraq then should give pause to blithe assertions that he
        wouldn&#x2019;t have used, or been goaded into using, the
        September&#xA0;11 attacks as a pretext for invasion, as did Bush. As I
        also note in the article, Clinton conducted nearly as many military
        interventions as Reagan and Bush the Elder [combined], and in four fewer
        years.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what do we say about the social impact of Clinton&#x2019;s support
        for financial deregulation and his role in gutting the federal
        commitment to provide income-support and housing for the poor? Or his
        failure to pursue labor law reform when he had the opportunity? What
        about NAFTA? And that leads us to the nearly parodic imagery of
        Obama&#x2019;s simultaneously tossing off a passing gesture of concern
        with inequality&#x2014;worthy of a more florid version of
        <a

          >Mr.&#xA0;Mackey from South Park</a
        >
        (&#x201C;Inequality is bad, mmkay&#x201D;)&#x2014;and then heading off
        to twist Congressional Democrats&#x2019; arms to support fast track for
        the Trans-Pacific Partnership &#x201C;trade&#x201D; agreement, which
        certainly would produce a bunch
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obamas-state-of-the-union_b_4658767"
          >more inequality</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the good news is that Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid stood up to
        him, at least for now, and that is an argument for the relative
        difference that having approachable Democrats in office can make.
        We&#x2019;ll see how long that victory lasts, but it most likely
        wouldn&#x2019;t have been possible without Democrats who feel beholden
        to the progressive groups that lobbied them so hard to rebuff the
        president. It also wouldn&#x2019;t have been possible without that
        pressure from outside the administration and the wing of the Democratic
        Party with which it&#x2019;s aligned. (Anyone recall Rahm Emanuel, Penny
        Pritzker, and Austan Goolsbee, just to name some of the Chicago crew?)
      </p>
      <p>
        The victory on fast track illustrates the nature of the Left&#x2019;s
        relation with the Dems. Sometimes we can stop something really bad from
        happening. That&#x2019;s not chopped liver. We&#x2019;ll have to see
        what happens next. But we haven&#x2019;t been able to win anything that
        a left would want in a long time, longer than most of the
        <em>Nation</em>&#x2019;s ideal readers can remember. Sen.&#xA0;Paul
        Wellstone observed nearly two decades ago that the GOP proposes
        something really, really terrible; the Dems respond with something
        somewhat less terrible, which we &#x201C;win&#x201D; and then celebrate
        a victory that actually may have made things somewhat worse overall.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one could have more contempt than I for Bush&#x2019;s debasement of
        FEMA and his role, along with his loathsome henchmen Michael Brown and
        Michael Chertoff, in perpetration of the criminal travesty in New
        Orleans post-Katrina. However, Goldberg should slow her roll there,
        also. Erosion of the wetlands that protected the city, intensified by
        years of bipartisan sweetheart deals for the energy industry, and
        inadequate and shoddy construction and maintenance of the levees,
        preceded Bush. The latter was the product of decades of bipartisan
        neoliberal attacks on the public sector and more sweetheart
        deals&#x2014;just as is the Obama administration&#x2019;s current attack
        on public education nationwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem, once again, isn&#x2019;t voting for Democrats; it&#x2019;s
        letting a rightward-tacking Democratic Party set the political horizons
        and agenda for&#x2014;and exhaust the practical political imagination
        of&#x2014;those who see themselves as a Left.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once again, as I said in the <em>Harper&#x2019;s</em> essay, even in
        practical terms, we most often have no realistic choice other than to
        vote for Democrats as lesser evils. The fact that those of us who
        consider ourselves on the Left must confront is that what the electoral
        options come down to is a choice between a neoliberal party that
        actively supports diversity and multiculturalism, and a neoliberal party
        that actively opposes diversity and multiculturalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between the two, clearly the more open version of neoliberalism that the
        Dems offer is less bad than the other. Especially from the standpoint of
        a Left, however, the crucial focus of politics must be to struggle to
        change the terms of debate that leave us with such impoverished choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#x2019;s only in the context of a shriveled political imagination
        that that stance looks like nihilism.
