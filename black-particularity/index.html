        This statement captures the central cultural dynamic of a
        &#x201C;late&#x201D; capitalism. The triumph of the commodity form over
        every sphere of social existence has been made possible by a profound
        homogenization of work, play, aspirations and self-definition among
        subject populations&#x2014;a condition Marcuse has characterized as
        one-dimensionality.<a

        Ironically, while US radicals in the late 1960s fantasized about a
        &#x201C;new man&#x201D; in the abstract, capital was in the process of
        concretely putting the finishing touches on <em>its new individual</em>.
        Beneath the current
        black-female-student-chicano-homosexual-old-young-handicapped,
        <em>etc</em>., <em>etc</em>., <em>ad nauseam</em>,
        &#x201C;struggles&#x201D; lies a simple truth: there is no coherent
        opposition to the present administrative apparatus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly, repression contributed significantly to the extermination of
        opposition and there is a long record of systematic corporate and state
        terror, from the Palmer Raids to the FBI campaign against the Black
        Panthers. Likewise, cooptation of individuals and programs has blunted
        opposition to bourgeois hegemony throughout this century, and cooptive
        mechanisms have become inextricable parts of strategies of containment.
        However, repression and cooptation can never fully explain the failure
        of opposition, and an exclusive focus on such external factors diverts
        attention from possible sources of failure within the opposition, thus
        paving the way for the reproduction of the pattern of failure. The
        opposition must investigate its own complicity.

        During the 1960s theoretical reflexiveness was difficult because of the
        intensity of activism. When sharply drawn political issues demanded
        unambiguous responses, reflection on unintended consequences seemed
        treasonous. A decade later, coming to terms with what happened during
        that period is blocked by nostalgic glorification of fallen heroes and
        by a surrender which Gross describes as the &#x201C;ironic frame of
        mind.&#x201D;<a

        Irony and nostalgia are two sides of the coin of resignation, the
        product of a cynical inwardness that makes retrospective critique seem
        tiresome or uncomfortable.<a
          href="#fn4"

        At any rate, things have not moved in an emancipatory direction despite
        all claims that the protest of the 1960s has extended equalitarian
        democracy. In general, opportunities to determine one&#x2019;s destiny
        are no greater now than before and, more importantly, the critique of
        life-as-it-is disappeared as a practical activity; <em>i.e.</em>, an
        ethical and political commitment to emancipation seems no longer
        legitimate, reasonable or valid. The amnestic principle, which imprisons
        the social past, also subverts any hope, which ends up seeking refuge in
        the predominant forms of alienation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also true in the black community. Black opposition has dissolved
        into celebration and wish-fulfillment. Today&#x2019;s political
        criticism within the black community&#x2014;both Marxist-Leninist and
        nationalist&#x2014;lacks a base and is unlikely to attract substantial
        constituencies. This complete collapse of political opposition among
        blacks, however, is anomalous. From the 1956 Montgomery bus boycott to
        the 1972 African Liberation Day demonstration, there was almost constant
        political motion among blacks. Since the early 1970s there has been a
        thorough pacification; or these antagonisms have been so depoliticized
        that they can surface only in alienated forms. Moreover, few attempts
        have been made to explain the atrophy of opposition within the black
        community.<a
          href="#fn5"

        Theoretical reflexiveness is as rare behind Dubois&#x2019; veil as on
        the other side!
      </p>
      <p>
        This critical failing is especially regrettable because black radical
        protests and the system&#x2019;s adjustments to them have served as
        catalysts in universalizing one-dimensionality <em>and</em> in moving
        into a new era of monopoly capitalism. In this new era, which Piccone
        has called the age of &#x201C;artificial negativity,&#x201D; traditional
        forms of opposition have been made obsolete by a new pattern of social
        management.<a
          href="#fn6"

        Now, the social order legitimates itself by integrating potentially
        antagonistic forces into a logic of centralized administration. Once
        integrated, these forces regulate domination and prevent disruptive
        excess. Furthermore, when these internal regulatory mechanisms do not
        exist, the system must create them. To the extent that the black
        community has been pivotal in this new mode of administered domination,
        reconstruction of the trajectory of the 1960s&#x2019; black activism can
        throw light on the current situation and the paradoxes it generates.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common interpretation of the demise of black militancy suggests that
        the waning of radical political activity is a result of the satisfaction
        of black aspirations. This satisfaction allegedly consists in: (1)
        extension of the social welfare apparatus; (2) elimination of legally
        sanctioned racial barriers to social mobility; which in turn has allowed
        for (3) expansion of possibilities open to blacks <em>within</em> the
        existing social system; all of which have precipitated (4) a
        redefinition of &#x201C;appropriate&#x201D; black political strategy in
        line with these achievements.<a
          href="#fn7"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref7"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>7</sup></a
        >
        This new strategy is grounded in a pluralist orientation that construes
        political issues solely in terms of competition for the redistribution
        of goods and services within the bounds of fixed system priorities.
        These four items constitute the &#x201C;gains of the 1960s.&#x201D;<a
          href="#fn8"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref8"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>8</sup></a
        >
        Intrinsic to this interpretation is the thesis that black political
        activity during the 1960s became radical because blacks had been
        excluded from society and politics and were therefore unable to
        effectively to solve group problems through the &#x201C;normal&#x201D;
        political process. Extraordinary actions were thus required to pave the
        way for regular participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This interpretation is not entirely untenable. With passage of the 1964
        and 1965 legislation the program of the Civil Rights movement appeared
        to have been fulfilled. Soon, however, it became clear that the ideals
        of freedom and dignity had not been realized, and within a year, those
        ideals reasserted themselves in the demand for black power. A social
        program was elaborated, but again its underpinning ideals were not
        realized. The dilemma lay in translating abstract ideals into concrete
        political goals, and it is here also that the &#x201C;gains of the
        sixties&#x201D; interpretation founders. It collapses ideals and the
        appropriateness of the programs in question.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be sure, racial segregation has been eliminated in the South, thus
        removing a tremendous oppression from black life. Yet, the dismantlement
        of the system of racial segregation only removed a fetter blocking the
        <em>possibility</em> of emancipation. In this context, computation of
        the &#x201C;gains of the sixties&#x201D; can begin only at the point
        where that extraordinary subjugation was eliminated. What, then, are
        those &#x201C;gains&#x201D; which followed the passage of civil rights
        legislation, and how have they affected black life?
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1967 black unemployment was over seven percent; for the first five
        months of 1978, it averaged over twelve percent.<a

        Between 1969 and 1974 the proportion of the black population classified
        as &#x201C;low income&#x201D; has remained virtually the same.<a

        Black median income did not improve significantly in relation to white
        family income in the decade after passage of civil rights legislation,<a

        Moreover, blacks are still far more likely to live in inadequate housing
        than whites, and black male life expectancy has declined, both
        absolutely and relative to whites, since 1959&#x2013;61.<a
          href="#fn13"

      <p>
        Thus, the material conditions of the black population as a whole have
        not improved appreciably. Therefore, if the disappearance of black
        opposition is linked directly with the satisfaction of aspirations, the
        criteria of fulfillment cannot be drawn from the general level of
        material existence in the black community. The same can be said for
        categories such as &#x201C;access to political decision-making.&#x201D;
        Although the number of blacks elected or appointed to public office has
        risen by leaps and bounds since the middle 1960s, that increase has not
        demonstrably improved life in the black community.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is one of focus. The &#x201C;gains of the sixties&#x201D;
        thesis seems to hold only as long as the &#x201C;black community&#x201D;
        is seen as a monolithic social aggregation. Although black life
        <em>as a whole</em> has not improved considerably beyond the elimination
        of racial segregation, in the 1970s certain strata within the black
        community have actually benefited. This development is a direct outcome
        of the 1960s activism: of the interplay of the &#x201C;movement&#x201D;
        and the integrative logic of administrative capitalism. And this
        &#x201C;gains of the sixties&#x201D; interpretation cannot spell out
        what &#x201C;satisfaction&#x201D; is because it is itself the ideology
        of precisely those strata which have benefited from the events of the
        1960s within the black community. These &#x201C;leadership&#x201D;
        strata tend to generalize their own interests since they see their
        legitimacy and integrity tied to a monolithic conceptualization of black
        life. Indeed, this conceptualization appeared in the unitarian mythology
        of late 1960s black nationalism. The representation of the black
        community as a collective subject neatly concealed the system of
        hierarchy which mediated the relation of the &#x201C;leaders&#x201D; and
        the &#x201C;led.&#x201D;<a

        To analyze the genesis of this new elite is to analyze simultaneously
        the development of domination in American society in general.
        Consequently, the following will focus on sources of the pacification of
        the 1970s and will expose the limitations of any oppositionist activity
        which proceeds uncritically from models of mass-organization politics.
        This approach tends to capitulate to the predominant logic of
        domination.

        Black resistance to oppression hardly began in Montgomery, Alabama, in
        1955. Yet, it was only then that opposition to racial subjugation
        assumed the form of a mass movement. Why was this so? Despite many
        allusions to the impact of &#x201C;decolonization&#x201D; in Africa,
        international experiences of blacks in World War II, and so on, the
        reasons why black activism exploded in the late 1950s have seldom been
        addressed systematically.<a
          href="#fn15"

          ><sup>15</sup></a

        Although resistance before 1955 was undoubtedly reinforced by the
        anti-colonial movements abroad, what was significant for post-1955
        growth of Civil Rights activity were those forces reshaping the entire
        American social order. A historically thorough perspective on the
        development of black opposition requires an understanding of the Cold
        War era in which it took shape.

        Although popularly symbolized by &#x201C;brinkmanship,&#x201D;
        &#x201C;domino theory,&#x201D; fallout shelters and the atmosphere of
        terror characterized by McCarthy, HUAC and legions of meticulously
        anti-communist liberals, the Cold War was a much broader cultural
        phenomenon. Ultimately, it was a period of consolidation of the new mode
        of domination which had been developing for over two decades. Piccone
        has noted that the Cold War era was the culmination of a dynamic of
        political and cultural adjustment over the American economy by the
        1920s.<a

        On the political front, the New Deal redefined the role of the state
        apparatus in terms of an aggressive, countercyclical intervention in the
        economy and everyday reality. At the same time, mass production required
        intensification of consumption. This requirement was met by the
        development and expansion of a consciously manipulative culture industry
        and by the proliferation of an ideology of consumerism through mass
        communications and entertainment media.<a

        Consumerism and the New Deal led to an intensification of the
        Taylorization of labor, which homogenized American life according to the
        dictates of bureaucratic-instrumental rationality. By the 1950s,
        Americanization had been institutionalized. Rigid political,
        intellectual and cultural conformism (Riesman&#x2019;s
        &#x201C;other-directedness&#x201D;) evidenced a social integration
        achieved through introjection and reproduction of the imperatives of the
        system of domination at the level of everyday life.<a

        Pressures toward homogenization exerted for decades at work, in schools
        and through the culture industry had eliminated any authentic cultural
        particularity among ethnic groups. What remained were residues of the
        lost cultures&#x2014;empty mannerisms and ambivalent ethnic identities
        mobilizable for Democratic electoral politics.<a

        Moreover, the pluralist model was already available for integrating the
        depoliticized labor movement. In this context, the ruthless elimination
        of whatever opposition remained through the witch-hunts was only the
        <em>coup de gr&#xE2;ce</em> in a battle already won.

        For various reasons, throughout this period, one region was bypassed in
        the monopolistic reorganization of American life and remained
        unintegrated into the new social order. At the end of World War II, the
        South remained the only internal frontier available for large-scale
        capital penetration. However, even though the South could entice
        industry with a docile work force accustomed to low wages, full
        domestication of this region required certain basic adjustments.

        For one thing, the caste-like organization of southern society seriously
        inhibited development of a rational labor supply. While much has been
        made of the utility of the segregated work force as a depressant of
        general wage levels, the maintenance of dual labor markets creates a
        barrier to labor recruitment.<a

        As a pariah caste, blacks could not adequately become an industrial
        reserve army since they were kept out of certain jobs. Consequently, in
        periods of rapid expansion the suppressed black labor pool could not be
        fully used. Nor could blacks be mobilized as a potential strike-breaking
        force as readily as in other regions, since employment of blacks in
        traditionally &#x201C;white&#x201D; jobs could trigger widespread
        disruptions.

        The dual labor system was irreconcilable with the principle of reducing

        A work force stratified on the basis of an economically irrational
        criterion such as race constitutes a serious impediment to realization
        of the ideal of a labor pool comprised of equivalent units. (Consider
        further the wastefulness of having to provide two sets of toilets in the
        plants!) In addition, the existing system of black subjugation, grounded
        in brutality, was intrinsically unstable. The racial order which
        demanded for its maintenance constant terror raised at every instant the
        possibility of rebellion and to that extent endangered
        &#x201C;rational&#x201D; administration. Given this state of affairs,
        the corporate elite&#x2019;s support for an anti-segregationist
        initiative makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        The relation of the corporate liberal social agenda to Civil Rights
        protest is not a causal one. True, the Supreme Court had been chipping
        away at legal segregation for nearly 20 years, and the 1954
        <em>Brown</em> decision finally provided the spark for intensified black
        protest. Yet, the eruption of resistance from southern blacks had its
        own roots. Hence, to claim that the Civil Rights movement was a
        bourgeois conspiracy would be to succumb to the order&#x2019;s myth of
        its own omnipotence. Thus, the important question is not whether sectors
        of the corporate elite orchestrated the Civil Rights movement, but
        instead what deficiencies within the Civil Rights movement were
        sufficiently compatible with the social agenda of corporate elites to
        prompt the latter to acquiesce to and encourage them. In order to answer
        this, it is necessary to identify both the social forces operative
        <em>within</em> the black community during segregation and those
        forces&#x2019; engagement in Civil Rights activism. An analysis of the
        internal dynamic of the 1960s activism shows overlaps between the goals
        of the &#x201C;New Deal offensive&#x201D; and the objectives of the
        &#x201C;movement&#x201D; (and, by extension, the black community).<a

        For the purposes of this analysis, the most salient aspects of the black
        community in the segregated South lie within a management dimension.
        Externally, the black population was managed by means of codified
        subordination, reinforced by customary dehumanization and the
        omnipresent specter of terror. The abominable details of this system are
        well known.<a
          href="#fn24"
          class="footnote-ref"

        Furthermore, blacks were systematically excluded from formal
        participation in public life. By extracting tax revenues without
        returning public services or allowing blacks to participate in public
        policy formation, the local political system intensified the normal
        exploitation in the workplace. Public administration of the black
        community was carried out by whites. The daily indignity of the
        apartheid-like social organization was both a product of this
        political-administrative disenfranchisement as well as a motor of its
        reproduction. Thus, the abstract ideal of freedom spawned within the
        Civil Rights movement addressed primarily this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the black population&#x2019;s alienation from public
        policy-making, an internal stratum existed which performed notable, but
        limited, social management functions. This elite stratum was comprised
        mainly of low-level state functionaries, merchants and
        &#x201C;professionals&#x201D; servicing black markets, and the clergy.
        While it failed to escape the general subordination, this indigenous
        elite usually succeeded, by virtue of its comparatively secure living
        standard and informal relations with significant whites, in avoiding the
        extremes of racial oppression. The importance of this stratum was that
        it stabilized and coordinated the adjustment of the black population to
        social policy imperatives formulated outside the black community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Insofar as black public functionaries had assimilated bureaucratic
        rationality, the domination of fellow blacks was carried out in
        &#x201C;doing one&#x2019;s job.&#x201D; For parts of the black elite
        such as the clergy, the ministerial practice of &#x201C;easing community
        tensions&#x201D; has always meant accommodation of black life to the
        existing forms of domination. Similarly, the independent merchants and
        professionals owed their relatively comfortable position within the
        black community to the special, captive markets created by segregation.
        Moreover, in the role of &#x201C;responsible Negro spokesmen,&#x201D;
        this sector was able to elicit considerable <em>politesse</em>, if not
        solicitousness, from &#x201C;enlightened&#x201D; members of the white
        elite. Interracial &#x201C;cooperation&#x201D; on policy matters was
        thus smoothly accomplished, and the &#x201C;public interest&#x201D;
        seemed to be met simply because opposition to white ruling-group
        initiatives had been effectively neutralized. The activating factor in
        this management relation was a notion of &#x201C;Negro
        leadership&#x201D; (later &#x201C;black&#x201D; or even
        &#x201C;Black&#x201D;) that was generated outside the black community. A
        bitter observation made from time to time by the radical fringe of the
        movement was that the social category &#x201C;leaders&#x201D; seemed
        only to apply to the black community. No &#x201C;white leaders&#x201D;
        were assumed to represent a singular white population. But certain
        blacks were declared opinion-makers and carriers of the interests of an
        anonymous black population. These &#x201C;leaders&#x201D; legitimated
        their role through their ability to win occasional favors from powerful
        whites and through the status positions they already occupied in the
        black community.<a
          href="#fn25"

      <p>
        This mode of domination could not thoroughly pacify black life: only the
        transformation of the segregated order could begin to do that.
        Furthermore, the internal management strategy generated centrifugal
        pressures of its own. In addition to segregation, three other disruptive
        elements stand out within the black community in the 1950s. First, the
        United States&#x2019; emergence from World War II as the major world
        power projected American culture onto an international scene. Thus, the
        anti-colonial movements that grew in Africa and Asia amid the crumbling
        of French and British colonial empires had a significant impact on black
        resistance in this country.<a
          href="#fn26"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref26"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>26</sup></a
        >
        Second, the logic of one-dimensionality itself became a disruptive
        element. The homogenizing egalitarianism of the &#x201C;New Deal&#x201D;
        generated a sense of righteousness able to sustain a lengthy battle with
        Southern segregation. The challenge to racial domination was justified
        in terms of the &#x201C;American Dream&#x201D; and an ideal of freedom
        expressed in a demand for full citizenship.<a
          href="#fn27"
          class="footnote-ref"

          role="doc-noteref"

        Thus, the same forces that since the 1920s had sought to integrate the
        various immigrant populations also generated an American national
        consciousness among blacks. By the 1950s a sense of participation in a
        national society had taken root even in the South, fertilized by the
        mass culture industry (including black publications), schools, and a
        defensive Cold War ideology. In the face of this growing national
        consciousness &#x201C;separate but equal&#x201D; existence was utterly
        intolerable to blacks. This is not to say that a perception rooted in
        the nation-state was universal among southern blacks in the 1950s,
        especially since the chief mechanisms of cultural adjustment such as
        television, popular films, compulsory schooling, <em>etc</em>., had not
        fully invaded the black community. Yet, mass culture and its corollary
        ideologies had extensively penetrated the private sphere of the black
        elite&#x2014;the stratum from which systematic opposition arose.<a
          href="#fn28"
          class="footnote-ref"

          ><sup>28</sup></a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, given the racial barrier, social mobility for the black elite was
        limited, relative to its white counterpart. Because of
        <em>de facto</em> proscription of black tenure in most professions, few
        possibilities existed for advancement. At the same time, the number of
        people seeking to become members of the elite had increased beyond what
        a segregated society could accommodate as a result of population growth
        and rising college attendance. In addition, upward mobility was being
        defined by the larger national culture in a way that further weakened
        the capability of the black elite to integrate its youth. Where ideology
        demanded nuclear physics and corporate management, black upward mobility
        rested with mortuary service and the Elks Lodge! The disjunction between
        ideals and possibilities delegitimated the elite&#x2019;s claim to
        brokerage and spokesmanship. With its role in question, the entrenched
        black elite was no longer able to effectively perform its internal
        management function and lost any authority with its
        &#x201C;recruits&#x201D; and the black community in general. As a
        result, a social space was cleared within which dissatisfaction with
        segregation could thrive as systematic opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this social management perspective, the sources of the
        &#x201C;Freedom Movement&#x201D; are identifiable within and on the
        periphery of its indigenous elite stratum. As soon as black opposition
        spilled beyond the boundaries of the black community, however, the
        internal management perspective became inadequate to understand further
        developments in the Civil Rights movement. When opposition to
        segregation became political rebellion, black protest required a
        response from white ruling elites. That response reflected the
        congruence of the interests of blacks and of corporate elites in
        reconstructing southern society and helped define the logic of all
        subsequent black political activity. Both sets of interests shared an
        interest in rationalizing race relations in the South. The Civil Rights
        movement brought the two sets together.<a
          href="#fn29"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref29"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>29</sup></a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The alliance of corporate liberalism and black protest was evident in
        the aggressive endorsement of Civil Rights activity that was mobilized
        by the New Deal coalition. Major labor organizations and
        &#x201C;enlightened&#x201D; corporate sectors immediately climbed aboard
        the freedom train through the &#x201C;progressive&#x201D; wing of the
        Democratic Party and private foundations. Moreover, it was through its
        coverage of black resistance in the South that television developed and
        refined its remarkable capabilities for creating public opinion by means
        of &#x201C;objective&#x201D; news reportage (a talent that reached its
        acme years later with the expulsion of Richard Nixon from the
        presidency). But television was not alone on the cultural front of the
        ideological struggle. <em>Life</em>, <em>Look</em>, the
        <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>, major non-southern newspapers, and other
        national publications featured an abundance of photo-essays that
        emphasized the degradation and brutalization of black life under Jim
        Crow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even popular cinema sought to thematize black life in line with civil
        rights consciousness in films such as <em>The Defiant Ones</em> (1958),
        <em>All the Young Men</em> (1960), <em>Raisin in the Sun</em> (1961),
        <em>Band of Angels</em> (1957), and the instructively titled
        <em>Nothing but a Man</em> (1964). Those and other films were marked by
        an effort to portray blacks with a measure of human depth and complexity
        previously absent from Hollywood productions. By 1957 even the great
        taboo of miscegenation could be portrayed on the screen in
        <em>Island in the Sun</em>, and a decade later the cultural campaign had
        been so successful that this theme could be explored in the parlor
        rather than in back streets and resolved with a happy ending in
        <em>Guess Who&#x2019;s Coming to Dinner</em>. It is interesting that
        Dorothy Dandridge became the first black in a leading role to be
        nominated for an Academy Award for her role in <em>Carmen</em> in
        1954&#x2014;the year of the <em>Brown</em> decision&#x2014;and that the
        most productive periods of civil rights activism and Sidney
        Poitier&#x2019;s film career coincided. Poitier&#x2019;s lead
        performance in the maudlin <em>Lilies of the Field</em> won an Oscar for
        him in 1963, on the eve of the passage of the Public Accommodations Act!
        Thus endorsed by the culture industry (which affronted White Supremacy
        in the late 1950s by broadcasting a Perry Como show in which comedienne
        Molly Goldberg kissed black ballplayer Ernie Banks) the Civil Rights
        movement was virtually assured success.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the Civil Rights coalition was made possible by the compatibility
        of the allies&#x2019; interests in reorganizing the South, its success
        was facilitated by the ideals and ideologies generated in the protest.
        Even though there had been ties between black southern elites and
        corporate-liberal elements for a long time, if the civil rights program
        had raised fundamental questions regarding social structure, the
        corporate-elite response may have been suppression rather than
        support&#x2014;especially given the Cold War context. Instead, from the
        very beginning the American establishment outside of Dixie supported the
        abolition of segregation.<a
          href="#fn30"
          class="footnote-ref"

          ><sup>30</sup></a
        >
        At any rate, it is clear that the civil rights ideology fit very well
        with the goals of monopoly capitalism. The Civil Rights movement
        appealed to egalitarianism and social rationality. On both counts
        segregation was found wanting while leaving non-racial features of the
        social order unquestioned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The egalitarian argument was moral as well as constitutional. The moral
        argument was in the bourgeois tradition from the Reformation to the
        French Revolution. It claimed equal rights for all human beings as well
        as entitlement to equal life chances. This abstract and ahistorical
        moral imperative did not grasp social relations beyond their phenomenal
        forms and therefore could only denounce racial exclusion as an evil
        anomaly. The predominant form of social organization was uncritically
        accepted and the moral imperative was predictably construed in terms of
        American constitutional law. Equality before the law and equality of
        opportunity to participate in all areas of citizenship were projected as
        needed extensions to blacks in the backward South to fulfill the promise
        of democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coexisting with this egalitarian ideology was the Civil Rights
        movement&#x2019;s appeal to a functionalist conception of social
        rationality. To the extent that it blocked individual aspirations,
        segregation was seen as restricting artificially social growth and
        progress. Similarly, by raising artificial barriers such as the
        constriction of blacks&#x2019; consumer power through Jim Crow
        legislation and, indirectly, through low black wages, segregation
        impeded, so the argument went, the free functioning of the market.
        Consequently, segregation was seen not only as detrimental to the blacks
        who suffered under it, but also to economic progress as such. Needless
        to say, the two lines of argument were met with approval by corporate
        liberals.<a

      <p>
        It is apparent now that the egalitarian ideology coincided with
        corporate-liberalism&#x2019;s cultural program of homogenization. Civil
        Rights&#x2019; egalitarianism demanded that any one unit of labor be
        equivalent to any other, that one citizen-consumer be considered
        equivalent to another, and that the Negro be thought of as &#x201C;any
        other American.&#x201D; There is more than a little irony that the Civil
        Rights movement demanded for blacks the same &#x201C;eradication of
        otherness&#x201D; that had been forced upon immigrant populations. The
        demand hardly went unheard; through the blanket concept
        &#x201C;integration&#x201D; and the alliance with a corporate elite that
        was all too ready to help clarify issues and refine strategies and
        objectives, the abstract ideals of Civil Rights activism were
        concretized in the corporate elite&#x2019;s plan for pacification and
        reorganization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The elimination of segregation in the South destroyed the specificity of
        both the South as a region and blacks as a group, and the rationality in
        whose name the movement had appealed paved the way for reconstruction of
        new modes of domination of black life. The movement had begun as a
        result of the frustrations of the black elite, and it ended with the
        achievement of autonomy and mobility among those elements. Public
        Accommodations and Voting Rights legislation officially defined new
        terms for the management of blacks and an expanded managerial role for
        the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the Civil Rights movement did have a radical faction, this wing
        failed to develop a systematic critique of civil rights ideology or the
        alliance with corporate liberalism. Moreover, the radicals&#x2014;mainly
        within SNCC&#x2014;never repudiated the leadership ideology which
        reinforced the movement&#x2019;s character as an elite brokerage
        relation with powerful whites outside the South. Thus, the radicals
        helped isolate their own position by acquiescing to a conception of the
        black community as a passive recipient of political symbols and
        directives. When the dust settled, the black &#x201C;mainstream&#x201D;
        elements and their corporate allies&#x2014;who together monopolized the
        symbols of legitimacy&#x2014;proclaimed that freedom had been achieved,
        and the handful of radicals could only feel uneasy that voting rights
        and &#x201C;social equality&#x201D; were somehow insufficient.<a

        Outside the South, rebellion arose from different conditions. Racial
        segregation was not rigidly codified and the management sub-systems in
        the black community were correspondingly more fluidly integrated within
        the local administrative apparatus. Yet, structural, generational and
        ideological pressures, broadly similar to those in the South, existed
        within the black elite in the Northern, Western, and Midwestern cities
        that had gained large black populations in the first half of the 20<sup

        century. In non-segregated urban contexts, formal political
        participation and democratized consumption had long since been achieved:
        there the salient political issue was the extension of the
        administrative purview of the elite within the black community. The
        centrality of the administrative nexus in the &#x201C;revolt of the
        cities&#x201D; is evident from the ideological programs it generated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black Power came about as a call for indigenous control of economic and
        political institutions in the black community.<a

          ><sup>33</sup></a
        >
        Because one of the early slogans of Black Power was a vague demand for
        &#x201C;community control,&#x201D; the emancipatory character of the
        rebellion was open to considerable misinterpretation. Moreover, the
        diversity and &#x201C;militancy&#x201D; of its rhetoric encouraged
        extravagance in assessing the movement&#x2019;s depth. It soon became
        clear, however, that &#x201C;community control&#x201D; called not for
        direction of pertinent institutions&#x2014;schools, hospitals, police,
        retail businesses, <em>etc</em>.&#x2014;by their black constituents, but
        for administration of those institutions by alleged representatives
        <em>in the name of</em> a black community. Given an existing elite
        structure whose legitimacy had already been certified by federal
        social-welfare agencies, the selection of &#x201C;appropriate&#x201D;
        representatives was predictable. Indeed, as Robert Allen has shown,<a
          href="#fn34"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref34"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>34</sup></a
        >
        the empowerment of this elite was actively assisted by corporate-state
        elements. Thus, &#x201C;black liberation&#x201D; quickly turned into
        black &#x201C;equity,&#x201D; &#x201C;community control&#x201D; became
        simply &#x201C;black control,&#x201D; and the Nixon
        &#x201C;blackonomics&#x201D; strategy was readily able to
        &#x201C;coopt&#x201D; the most rebellious tendency of 1960s black
        activism. Ironically, Black Power&#x2019;s supersession of the Civil
        Rights program led to further consolidation of the management
        elite&#x2019;s hegemony within the black community. The black elite
        broadened its administrative control by uncritically assuming the
        legitimacy of the social context within which that elite operated. Black
        control was by no means equivalent to democratization.
      </p>
      <p>
        This state of affairs remained unclear even to Black Power&#x2019;s
        radical fringe. Such a failure of political perception cannot be written
        off as crass opportunism or as underdeveloped consciousness. Though not
        altogether false, explanations of this kind only beg the question.
        Indeed, Black Power radicalism, which absorbed most of the floundering
        left wing of the Civil Rights movement and generated subsequent
        &#x201C;nationalist&#x201D; tendencies, actually blurred the roots of
        the new wave of rebellion. As Civil Rights activism exhausted itself and
        as spontaneous uprisings proliferated among urban blacks, the Civil
        Rights radicals sought to generate an ideology able to unify and
        politicize these uprisings. This effort, however, was based on two
        mystifications that implicitly rationalized the elite&#x2019;s control
        of the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, Black Power presupposed a mass-organizational model built on the
        assumption of a homogeneity of black political interests to be dealt
        with through community leadership. It is this notion of &#x201C;black
        community&#x201D; that has blocked development of a radical critique in
        the Civil Rights movement by contraposing an undifferentiated mass to a
        leadership stratum representing it. This understanding ruled out any
        analysis of cleavages or particularities within the black population:
        &#x201C;community control&#x201D; and &#x201C;black control&#x201D;
        became synonymous. The implications of this ideology have already been
        discussed: having internalized the predominant elite-pluralist model of
        organization of black life, the radical wing could not develop any
        critical perspective. Internal critique could not go beyond banal
        symbols of &#x201C;blackness,&#x201D; and thus ended up stimulating
        demand for a new array of &#x201C;revolutionary&#x201D; consumer goods.
        Notwithstanding all its bombast, Black Power construed racial politics
        within the ideological universe through which the containment of the
        black population was mediated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acceptance of this model not only prevented Black Power from
        transcending the social program of the indigenous administrative elite,
        but it also indicated the extent to which, as Cruse was aware at the
        time,<a
          href="#fn35"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref35"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>35</sup></a
        >
        Black Power radicalism was itself a frantic statement of the
        elite&#x2019;s agenda&#x2014;hence the radicals&#x2019; chronic
        ambivalence over &#x201C;black bourgeoisie,&#x201D; capitalism,
        socialism and &#x201C;black unity.&#x201D; Their mystification of the
        social structure of the black community was largely the result of a
        failure to come to terms with their own privileged relation to the
        corporate elite&#x2019;s program of social reconstruction. This state of
        affairs precipitated a still more profound mystification that
        illuminates the other side of Black Power rebellion: the reaction
        against massification.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Civil Rights movement&#x2019;s demand for integration was
        superfluous outside the South, and Black Power was as much a reaction
        against integrationist ideology as against racial domination. Thus,
        while militant black nationalism developed as a reaction to the
        assimilationist approach of the Civil Rights movement, it simultaneously
        envisioned an obsolete model of black life. This yearning was
        hypostatized to the level of a &#x201C;black culture&#x201D;&#x2014;a
        romantic retrieval of a vanishing black particularity. This vision of
        black culture, of course, was grounded in residual features of black
        rural life prior to migrations to the North. They were primarily
        cultural patterns that had once been enmeshed in a lifeworld knitted
        together by kinship, voluntary association and production within a
        historical context of rural racial domination. As that lifeworld
        disintegrated before urbanization and mass culture, black nationalism
        sought to reconstitute it.<a
          href="#fn36"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref36"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>36</sup></a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        In that sense, the nationalist elaboration of Black Power was
        na&#xEF;ve, both in that it was not sufficiently self-conscious, and in
        that it mistook artifacts and idiosyncrasies of culture for its totality
        and froze them into an ahistorical theory of authenticity. Two
        consequences followed. First, abstracted from its concrete historical
        context, black culture lost its dynamism and took on the commodity form
        (<em>e.g.</em>, red, black and green flags, dashikis, Afro-Sheen,
        &#x201C;blaxploitation&#x201D; films, collections of bad poetry,
        <em>etc</em>.). Second, while ostensibly politicizing culture by
        defining it as an arena for conflict, black nationalism actually
        depoliticized the movement inasmuch as the reified nationalist framework
        could relate to the present only through a simplistic politics of
        unity.<a
          href="#fn37"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref37"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>37</sup></a
        >
        Hence, it forfeited hegemony over political programs to the
        best-organized element in the black community: the administrative elite.
        In this fashion, black culture became a means of legitimation of the
        elite&#x2019;s political hegemony.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black culture posited a functionalist, perfectly integrated black social
        order which was then projected backward through history as the
        <em>Truth</em> of black existence. The &#x201C;natural&#x201D; condition
        of harmony was said to have been disrupted only when divisiveness and
        conflict were introduced by alien forces. This myth delegitimated
        internal conflicts and hindered critical dialogue within the black
        community. Correspondingly, the intellectual climate which came to
        pervade within the &#x201C;movement&#x201D; was best summarized in the
        nationalists&#x2019; exhortation to &#x201C;think black,&#x201D; a
        latter-day version of &#x201C;thinking with one&#x2019;s blood.&#x201D;
        Thus was the circle completed: the original abstract rationalism that
        had ignored existing social relations of domination for a mythical,
        unitarian social ideal had turned into a militant and self-justifying
        irrationalism. Truth became a function of the speaker&#x2019;s
        &#x201C;blackness,&#x201D; <em>i.e.</em>, validity claims were to be
        resolved not through discourse but by the claimant&#x2019;s manipulation
        of certain banal symbols of legitimacy. The resultant situation greatly
        favored the well-organized and highly visible elite.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nationalist program functioned also as a mobilization myth. In
        defining a collective consciousness, the idealization of folkishness was
        simultaneously an exhortation to collectivized practice. The folk, in
        its Afro-American manifestation as well as elsewhere, was an ideological
        category of mass-organizational politics. The community was to be
        created and mobilized as a passively homogeneous mass, activated by a
        leadership elite.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the politicized notion of black culture was a negative response to
        the estrangement and anomie experienced in the urban North, as a
        &#x201C;solution&#x201D; it only <em>affirmed the negation</em> of
        genuine black particularity.<a
          href="#fn38"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref38"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>38</sup></a
        >
        The prescription of cohesion in the form of a mass leadership relation
        betrayed the movement&#x2019;s tacit acceptance of the agenda of the
        black management stratum. The negativity immanent in the cultural myth
        soon gave way to an opportunistic appeal to unity grounded on an
        unspecifiable &#x201C;blackness&#x201D; and a commodified idea of
        &#x201C;soul.&#x201D; Black unity, elevated to an end in itself, became
        an ideology promoting consolidation of the management elite&#x2019;s
        expanded power over the black population. In practice, unity meant
        collective acceptance of a set of demands to be lobbied by a leadership
        elite before the corporate-state apparatus. To that extent,
        &#x201C;radical&#x201D; Black Power reproduced on a more elaborate
        ideological basis the old pluralist brokerage politics. Similarly, this
        phony unity restricted possibilities for the development of a black
        public sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be sure, the movement stimulated widespread and lively political
        debate in the black community. Although it hardly approached an
        &#x201C;ideal speech situation,&#x201D; various individuals and
        constituencies were drawn into political discourse on a considerably
        more democratized basis than had previously been the case. Yet, the rise
        of unitarian ideology, coupled with a mysticized notion of
        &#x201C;expertise,&#x201D; effectively reintroduced hierarchy within the
        newly expanded political arena.<a
          href="#fn39"

          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>39</sup></a
        >
        At any rate, &#x201C;grass roots&#x201D; politics in the black community
        can be summarized as follows: the internal management elite claimed
        primacy in political discourse on the basis of its ability to project
        and realize a social program, and then mobilized the unitarian ideal to
        delegitimate any divergent positions. On the other hand, the
        &#x201C;revolutionary&#x201D; opposition offered no alternative; within
        its ranks the ideology of expertise was never repudiated. The radicals
        had merely replaced the elite&#x2019;s pragmatism with a mandarin
        version of expertise founded on mastery of the holy texts of Kawaida,
        Nkrumanism or &#x201C;scientific socialism.&#x201D; By the time of the
        1971 National Black Political Convention in Gary, the mainstream elite
        strata were well on the way to becoming the sole effective voice in the
        black community. By the next convention in 1974 in Little
        Rock&#x2014;after the election of a second wave of black
        officials&#x2014;their hegemony was total.<a
          href="#fn40"

        By now the reasons for the demise of black opposition in the US should
        be clear. The opposition&#x2019;s sources were formulated in terms of
        the predominant ideology and thereby readily integrated as an
        affirmation of the reality of the system as a whole. The movement
        &#x201C;failed&#x201D; because it &#x201C;succeeded,&#x201D; and its
        success can be measured by its impact on the administration of the
        social system. The protest against racial discrimination in employment
        and education was answered by the middle 1970s by state-sponsored
        democratization of access to management and other
        &#x201C;professional&#x201D; occupations. Clear, quantifiable racial
        discrimination remained a pressing public issue only for those whose
        livelihood depended on finding continuous instances of racial
        discrimination.<a
          href="#fn41"

          id="fnref41"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>41</sup></a
        >
        Still, equalization of access should not be interpreted simply as a
        concession: it also rationalized recruitment of intermediate management
        personnel. In one sense the affirmative action effort can be viewed as a
        publicly subsidized state and corporate talent search.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, the protest against external administration of black life was
        met by an expansion in the scope of the black political-administrative
        apparatus. Through federal funding requirements of community
        representation, reapportionment of electoral jurisdictions, support for
        voter &#x201C;education,&#x201D; and growth of the social welfare
        bureaucracy, the black elite was provided with broadened occupational
        opportunities and with official responsibility for administration of the
        black population. The rise of black officialdom in the latter 1970s
        signals the realization of the reconstructed elite&#x2019;s social
        program and the consolidation of its hegemony over black life. No longer
        do preachers, funeral directors and occasional politicos vie for the
        right to rationalize an externally generated agenda to the black
        community. Now, black officials and professional political activists
        represent, interact among, and legitimate themselves before an attentive
        public of black functionaries in public and private sectors of the
        social management apparatus.<a

          ><sup>42</sup></a
        >
        Even the ideological reproduction of the elite is assured: not only
        mass-market journalists, but black academicians as well (through black
        &#x201C;scholarly&#x201D; publications, research institutes and
        professional organizations) almost invariably sing the praises of the
        newly empowered elite.<a

      </p>
      <p>
        It was in the ideological sphere as well that the third major protest,
        that against massification of the black community, was resolved.
        Although authentic Afro-American particularity had been undermined by
        the standardizing imperatives of mass capitalism, the black nationalist
        reaction paved the way for the constitution of an artificial
        particularity.<a

          ><sup>44</sup></a
        >
        Residual idiomatic and physical traits, bereft of any distinctive
        content, were injected with racial stereotypes and the ordinary
        <em>petit-bourgeois Weltanschauung</em> to create the pretext for an
        apparently unique black existence. A thoroughly ideological construction
        of black uniqueness&#x2014;which was projected universally in the mass
        market as black culture&#x2014;fulfilled at least three major functions.
        First, as a marketing device it facilitated the huckstering of
        innumerable commodities designed to enhance, embellish, or glorify
        &#x201C;blackness.&#x201D;<a
          href="#fn45"

          id="fnref45"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>45</sup></a
        >
        Second, artificial black particularity provided the basis for the myth
        of genuine black community and consequently legitimated the organization
        of the black population into an administrative unit&#x2014;and,
        therefore, the black elite&#x2019;s claims to primacy. Finally, the
        otherness-without-negativity provided by the ideologized blackness can
        be seen as a potential antidote to the new contradictions generated by
        monopoly capitalism&#x2019;s bureaucratic rationality. By constituting
        an independently given sector of society responsive to administrative
        controls, the well-managed but recalcitrant black community justifies
        the existence of the administrative apparatus and legitimates existing
        forms of social integration.

      <p>
        In one sense, the decade and a half of black activism was a phenomenon
        vastly more significant than black activists appreciated, while in
        another sense it was far less significant than has been claimed.<a

        As an emancipatory project for the Afro-American population, the
        &#x201C;movement&#x201D;&#x2014;especially after the abolishment of
        segregation&#x2014;had little impact beyond strengthening the existing
        elite strata. Yet, as part of a program of advanced capitalist
        reconstruction, black activism contributed to thawing the Cold War and
        outlined a model to replace it.

        By the latter 1960s the New Deal coalition had become obsolete and it
        was no longer able to fully integrate recalcitrant social strata such as
        the black population.<a

        The New Deal coalition initiated the process of social homogenization
        and depoliticization that Marcuse described as one-dimensionality. As
        Piccone observes, however, by the 1960s the transition to monopoly
        capitalism had been fully carried out and the whole strategy had become
        counterproductive.<a

        The drive toward homogenization and the total domination of the
        commodity form had deprived the system of the &#x201C;otherness&#x201D;
        required both to restrain the irrational tendencies of bureaucratic
        rationality and to locate lingering and potentially disruptive elements.
        Notwithstanding their vast differences, the ethnic &#x201C;liberation
        struggles&#x201D; and counterculture activism on the one side, and the
        &#x201C;hard hat&#x201D; reaction on the other, were two sides of the
        same rejection of homogenization. Not only did these various positions
        challenge the one-dimensional order, but their very existence betrayed
        the inability of the totally administered society to pacify social
        existence while at the same time remaining sufficiently dynamic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The development of black activism from spontaneous protest through mass
        mobilization to system support indicated the arrival of a new era of
        domination based on domesticating negativity by organizing spaces in
        which it could be legitimately expressed. Rather than suppressing
        opposition, the social system now creates its own. The proliferation of
        government-generated reference groups in addition to ethnic ones (the
        old, the young, battered wives, the handicapped, veterans, retarded and
        gifted children, <em>etc</em>.)&#x200A;<a

        and the appearance of legions of &#x201C;watchdog&#x201D; agencies,

      <p>
        What makes the &#x201C;age of artificial negativity&#x201D; possible is
        the overwhelming success of the process of massification undertaken
        since the Depression and in response to it. Universal fragmentation of
        consciousness, with the corollary decline in the ability to think
        critically and the regimentation of an alienated everyday life,<a

        set the stage for new forms of domination built in the very texture of
        organization. In mass society, organized activity on a large scale
        requires hierarchization. Along with hierarchy, however, the social
        management logic also comes into being to (1) protect existing
        privileges by delivering realizable, if inconsequential, payoffs; and
        (2) to legitimate the administrative rationality as a valid and
        efficient model. To the extent that the organization strives to ground
        itself on the <em>mass</em>, it is already integrated into the system of
        domination. The shibboleths which comprise its specific platform make
        little difference. What is important is that the organization reproduces
        the manipulative hierarchy and values typical of contemporary
        capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Equally important for the existence of this social-managerial form is
        that the traditional modes of opposition to capitalism have not been
        able to successfully negotiate the transition from entrepreneurial to
        administrative capitalism. Thus, the left has not fully grasped the
        recent shifts in the structure of domination and continues to organize
        resistance along the very lines which reinforce the existing social
        order. As a consequence, the opposition finds itself perpetually
        outflanked. Unable to deliver the goods&#x2014;political or
        otherwise&#x2014;the left collapses before the cretinization of its own
        constituency. Once the mass model is accepted, cretinization soon
        follows and from that point the opposition loses any genuine negativity.
        The Civil Rights and Black Power movements prefigured the coming of this
        new age; the feminist photocopy of the black road to nowhere was its
        farcical re-run.
      </p>
      <p>
        The role of the mass culture industry in this context is to maintain and
        reproduce the new synthesis of domination. Here, again, the history of
        the &#x201C;black revolution&#x201D; is instructive. In its most radical
        stage Black Power lived and spread as a media event. Stokely Carmichael
        and Rap Brown entertained nightly on network news, and after ordinary
        black &#x201C;militancy&#x201D; had lost its dramatic appeal, the Black
        Panther Party added props and uniforms to make radical politics entirely
        a show-business proposition. Although late 1960s black radicalism
        offered perhaps the most flamboyant examples of the peculiar relation of
        the mass media to the would-be opposition, that was only an extreme
        expression of a pattern at work since the early days of the Civil Rights
        movement. Since then, political opposition has sought to propagandize
        its efforts through the mass media. Given the prevailing cretinization
        and the role of the culture industry in reproducing the fragmented,
        commodified consciousness, such a strategy, if pursued uncritically,
        could only reinforce the current modes of domination.<a

      </p>
      <p>
        That all forms of political opposition accepted the manipulative,
        mass-organization model gave the strategy a natural, uncomplicated
        appearance and prevented the development of a critical approach. The
        consequence was a propagation of a model of politics which reinforced
        over-simplification, the reduction of ideals to banalized objects of
        immediate consumption&#x2014;<em>i.e.</em>, the
        commodity-form&#x2014;and to an alienated, dehumanized hero cultishness
        with the &#x201C;revolutionary&#x201D; replacing either hero or villain.
        In short, opposition increasingly becomes a spectacle in a society
        organized around the reduction of all existence to a series of
        spectacles.<a

        So monopoly capitalism has entered a new stage typified by the extension
        of the administrative apparatus throughout everyday life. In this
        context, genuine opposition is checkmated <em>a priori</em> by the
        legitimation and projection of a partial, fragmented criticism which can
        readily be made functional in further streamlining the predominant
        rationality. And in cases where existing bureaucratic structures need
        control mechanisms to prevent excesses, diffused uneasiness with
        predominant institutions ends up artificially channeled into forms of
        negativity able to fulfill the needed internal control function. Always
        a problem for opposition which seeks to sustain itself over time, under
        the new conditions of administered negativity, this one step backward
        required by organized opposition&#x2019;s need to broaden its
        constituency and conduct &#x201C;positional warfare,&#x201D; becomes a
        one-way slide to affirmation of the social order. The logic of the
        transition to new forms of bourgeois hegemony requires the adjustment of
        administrative rationality. The unrestrained drive to total integration
        now is mediated by peripheral, yet systematically controlled, loci of
        criticism; one-dimensionality itself has been &#x201C;humanized&#x201D;
        by the cultivation of commodified facsimiles of diversity.<a

      <p>
        An important question remains: what of the possibilities for genuine
        opposition? The picture that has been painted seems excessively
        pessimistic. Yet, this should not be understood to mean that opposition
        is futile. It <em>is</em> necessary, though, to closely examine the
        customary modes of opposition. The theory of artificial negativity
        historicizes the critique of the post-Cold War left and suggests at the
        same time some broad outlines for a reconceptualization of emancipatory
        strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        This examination of black radicalism in the wake of its integration
        offers a microcosmic view of the plight of the left as a whole. Having
        accepted an organizational model based on massification, the radicals
        were forced to compete with the elite on the latter&#x2019;s
        terms&#x2014;an impossible proposition, since the elite had access to
        the cultural apparatus designed for mass mobilization. Moreover, even
        when opposition tried to reconstruct itself, it failed to generate
        systematic critique of its own strategy and was therefore unable to come
        to terms with shifts in the structure of capitalist social relations.
        Instead, it remained caught within a theoretical structure adequate only
        for an earlier, pre-administrative stage of capitalist development.
        Thus, the failure of mysticized black nationalism is reproduced in
        today&#x2019;s &#x201C;ideological struggles,&#x201D; which reached
        their nadir in the 1978 dispute over whether Mao Tse-tung was really
        dead!
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, what of possibilities? Certain implications follow from the
        previous analysis. It points in the direction of attempts to cultivate
        areas of unorganizable free space in the interstices of the social
        system, and to reduce the scope of appropriate political intervention
        from mass organization to the reconstitution of individuality. Clearly,
        this sketch provides no blueprint. In fact, it does not point to any
        really &#x201C;concrete&#x201D; direction. Yet, charges of pessimism are
        unwarranted. Hope must seek its possibilities in the darkest moments of
        the present; it is despair which hides its head from history and refuses
        to see the undesirable.<a

            That the leadership elite projects its interests over the entire
            black population is neither unique nor necessarily suggestive of
            insidious motives; however, it is just in the extent to which the

            John Hope Franklin does not raise the question in his standard
            volume,
            <em>From Slavery to Freedom: A History of Negro Americans</em>,
            third edition (New York, 1969); nor surprisingly does Harold
            Cruse&#x2019;s
            <em
              >The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual: From Its Origins to the
              Present</em
            >
            (New York, 1967), which is a seminal contribution to a reflexive
            theory of black political activity. That Cruse and Franklin fail to
            raise the question is perhaps because both&#x2014;reflecting an
            aspect of the conventional wisdom&#x2014;see an unbroken, if not
            cumulating, legacy of black activism in the twentieth century.
            Franklin sees the civil rights movement simply as the culmination of
            a century or more of protest. Cruse, in establishing the
            continuities of the poles of integrationism and nationalism,
            projects them back and forth from Douglass and Delaney to Black
            Power, glossing over significant historical differences in the
            process. In <em>The Making of Black Revolutionaries</em> (New York,
            1972), James Forman is so consumed by the movement&#x2019;s manifest
            and organizational unfoldings that he is unable to subordinate it to
            history. His account of the 1950s focuses entirely on his personal
            awakening. Louis Lomax, <em>The Negro Revolt</em>, revised edition
            (New York, 1971); Lewis Killian,
            <em
              >The Impossible Revolution? Black Power and the American Dream</em

            <em>The Negro Mood</em> (New York, 1964), and
            <em

            >, revised edition (Baltimore, 1969), all raise the question only to
            answer casually or to beg the question further. An all-too-common
            shortcoming, exemplified by each of the writers cited and extending
            throughout the study of black political activity, is a tendency to
            abstract black life from the currents of American history. The
            resulting scenarios of black existence suffer from superficiality.<a

            John Alt observes that, &#x201C;The problem of legitimating
            industrial reorganization was solved through a new social practice
            and ideology structured around the pursuit of money, material
            comfort, and a higher standard of living through consumerism. Mass
            consumption, as the necessary otherness of Taylorized mass
            production, was itself offered as the ultimate justification for the
            rationalization of labor.&#x201D; &#x201C;Beyond Class: The Decline

            apotheosis of consumerism, whose enshrinement during those years was
            aided by the continued spread of popular journalism and the
            &#x201C;mass marketing of television&#xA0;&#x2026; [which] carried

            the extent to which the one-dimensional order is reproduced in the
            individual, on the grounds that, &#x201C;Introjection implies the
            existence of an inner dimension distinguished from and even
            antagonistic to the external exigencies&#x2014;an individual

            The point is not that ethnicity has lost its power as a basis for
            self-identification or associational activity. What has been
            obliterated, however, is the distinctiveness of the institutional
            forms which were the source of group consciousness in the first
            place. Warner and Srole pridefully acknowledge the centrality of the
            prevailing order in the determination of ethnic consciousness:
            &#x201C;The forces which are most potent both in forming and
            changing the ethnic groups emanate from the institutions of the
            dominant American social system.&#x201D; W. Lloyd Warner and Leo
            Srole, <em>The Social Systems of American Ethnic Groups</em> (New
            Haven, 1945), 283&#x2013;4. Stuart and Elizabeth Ewen,
            &#x201C;Americanization and Consumption,&#x201D; <em>Telos</em> 37
            (Fall, 1978), observe that the dynamic of homogenization began with
            integration into the system of wage labor, which &#x201C;created
            great fissures and, ultimately, gaps in people&#x2019;s lives.
            Money&#xA0;&#x2026; rendered much of the way in which non-industrial
            peoples understood themselves, and the reproduction of their daily
            lives, useless. The money system itself was a widely disseminated
            <em>mass medium</em> which ripped the structure of peoples&#x2019;
            needs from their customary roots, and by necessity transplanted
            these needs in a soil nourished by the &#x2018;rationality&#x2019;
            of corporate industry and the retail marketplace&#x201D;
            (p.&#xA0;47). Traditional ethnic ways of life hardly stood a chance
            under conditions in which the terms of survival were also those of
            massification! See also Maurice R. Stein,

            A clarification is needed concerning use of the constructs

            Racial segregation and the movement against it were southern
            phenomena. Black Power &#x201C;nationalism&#x201D; was essentially a
            northern phenomenon for which legally sanctioned racial exclusion
            was not an immediate issue. Although the two historical currents of
            rebellion were closely related, they nevertheless were distinct.

            Certainly, the bizarre notion of black leadership was not an
            invention of the post-war era. That strategy of pacification had
            been the primary non-terroristic means for subduing black opposition
            since Booker T. Washington&#x2019;s network of alliances with
            corporate progressives and New South Bourbon Democrats. Moreover,
            the notion of a leadership stratum which was supposed to speak for a
            monolithic black community became the ideological model and
            political ideal for 1960s radicalism&#x2014;especially in its

            Concepts such as duplicity and cooptation are inadequate to shed
            light on why corporate and liberal interests actively supported the
            Civil Rights movement. Interpretations so derived cannot fully
            explain programs and strategies which originated in the black

            clothing. This kind of &#x201C;false consciousness&#x201D; thesis is
            theoretically unacceptable. Consciousness is false not when it is a
            lie forced from outside, but when it does not comprehend its
            historical one-sidedness.<a

            Of course, suppression was the reaction of certain elements, most
            notably within the state apparatus whose bureaucratized priorities
            urged suppression of any disruptive presence in the society. Howard
            Zinn, <em>SNCC: The New Abolitionists</em> (Boston, 1965), as well
            as Forman and Sellers, shows that the federal apparatus, which later
            developed a reputation at the &#x201C;grass roots&#x201D; as the
            patron saint of equality, was at best lukewarm in response to black
            demands for enforcement of constitutional rights and often set out
            to suppress tendencies and distinct personalities in the movement.
            Nevertheless, the movement was not suppressed, and not because it
            &#x201C;forced&#x201D; its will upon history. That bit of romantic
            back-slapping has as little credence as the one that contends that
            the anti-war movement ended the Vietnam War. The state hardly was
            mobilized against the Civil Rights activism; the Supreme Court had
            authorized its legitimacy before it even began.<a

            It was out of this milieu of muddled uneasiness that
            Rev.&#xA0;Willie Ricks gave the world the slogan, &#x201C;Black
            Power!&#x201D; on the Meridith march in 1966. A flavor of the
            frustration of the radicals at the time can be gotten from Julius
            Lester,
            <em
              >Look Out, Whitey! Black Power&#x2019;s Gon&#x2019; Get Your
              Mama</em
            >
            (New York, 1968). In some respects Lester&#x2019;s account, though
            more dated, has greater value for understanding this period than
            either Forman&#x2019;s or Sellers&#x2019; because
            <em>Look Out, Whitey!</em> is written from within Black Power,
            rather than retrospectively from the vantage point of new ideologies
            and old involvements that need to be protected. See also Stokely

            Jennifer Jordan notes this &#x201C;nostalgic&#x201D; character of
            1960s culturalism and its grounding in the black elite in an essay,

            Poetry,&#x201D; forthcoming in Barnette and Reed, eds.,
            <em>The Circles in the Spiral</em>. In the most systematic and
            thorough critical reconstruction of black cultural nationalism to
            date, Jordan identifies two core nationalist tendencies: one
            Afro-American preservationist, the other African retrievalist.
            Presumably, Ron Karenga is to be seen as a bridge between those
            tendencies with his commitment to &#x201C;creation, recreation and

            The fascination shared by most of the nationalists with the
            prospects of consciously creating a culture revealed both the loss
            of a genuine cultural base <em>and</em> the extent of the
            nationalists&#x2019; acceptance of manipulation as a strategy
            (cf.&#xA0;Karenga&#x2019;s &#x201C;seven criteria for
            culture,&#x201D; <em>Black Power Revolt</em>, p.&#xA0;166). The
            further away the nationalists chose to go to find their cultural
            referent, the more clearly they demonstrated the passage of a
            self-driving, spontaneous black existence from the arena of American
            history. The ultimate extension of escapism came with the growth of
            Pan-Africanism as an ideology; that turn&#x2014;at least in its most
            aggressive manifestations&#x2014;conceded as a first step the
            inauthenticity of <em>all</em> black American life. See Carmichael,

            This is not to say that blacks no longer are oppressed, nor that
            that oppression no longer has racial characteristics. Nor still is
            it possible to agree with Wilson&#x2019;s simplistic claim that race
            is receding as a factor in the organization of American society; as
            Harold Barnette notes, the integration of affirmative action
            programs into the social management apparatus suggests race&#x2019;s
            continuing significance. See William Julius Wilson,
            <em
              >The Declining Significance of Race: Blacks and Changing American
              Institutions</em
            >
            (Chicago, 1978); and Barnette&#x2019;s review in
            <em>Southern Exposure</em> 7 (Spring, 1979), 121&#x2013;2. With
            legitimation and absorption of anti-racism by the social management
            system, race has assumed a more substantial and pervasive function
            than ever before in American life. Moreover, this function is often
            life-sustaining; controlling discrimination has become a career
            specialty&#x2014;complete with &#x201C;professional,&#x201D;
            &#x201C;paraprofessional,&#x201D; and
            &#x201C;sub-professional&#x201D; gradations&#x2014;in public and
            private bureaucracies. However, &#x201C;racial
            discrimination&#x201D; fails as a basis from which to interpret or
            address black oppression.

            &#x201C;Racism&#x201D; is bound to an &#x201C;equality of
            opportunity&#x201D; ideology which can express only the interests of
            the elite strata among the black population; equality of access to
            the meaningless, fragmented and degrading jobs which comprise the
            bulk of work, for example, hardly is the stuff of &#x201C;black
            liberation&#x201D; and is ultimately a retrograde social demand. It
            is not an accident, therefore, that the only major battle produced
            by the struggle against racism in the 1970s has been the anti-Bakke
            movement, whose sole objective was protection of blacks&#x2019;
            access to the pursuit of professional employment status.

            Racism makes its appearance as an opaque reification grafted onto
            otherwise acceptable institutions. Small wonder it is the only issue
            the black elite can find to contend! Not only does racism carry the
            elite&#x2019;s sole critique of US society, but the claim that
            racism creates a bond of equivalent victimization among blacks is
            one of the sources of the elite&#x2019;s legitimation. It is
            interesting to recall in this context that &#x201C;racism&#x201D;
            became the orthodox explanation of black oppression when the Kerner
            Commission anointed it as the fundamental source of the
            1964&#x2013;7 urban uprisings.

            The most significant shift in the occupational structure of the
            black population in the decade after the 1964 Civil Rights Act was
            relative expansion of its elite component. Between 1964 and 1974 the
            percentage of minority males classified as &#x201C;professional and
            technical&#x201D; workers increased by half; the percentage
            classified as non-farm, salaried &#x201C;managers and

            The celebration of the new elite is not, as once was the case,
            restricted to black media. Stephen Birmingham has testified to their
            presence and allowed them to expose their personal habits in his
            characteristically gossipy style of pop journalism in his
            <em>Certain People: America&#x2019;s Black Elite</em> (Boston,
            1977). The <em>New York Times Sunday Magazine</em> twice at least
            has lionized the beautiful black stratum of the 1970s. See Peter
            Ross Range, &#x201C;Making It in Atlanta: Capital of &#x2018;Black
            Is Bountiful,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D;
            <em>New York Times Sunday Magazine</em>, April 7, 1974; and William
            Brashler, &#x201C;The Black Middle Class: Making It,&#x201D; in the
            Dec.&#xA0;5, 1978 magazine. Each of these brassy accounts tends,
            despite occasional injections of &#x201C;balance,&#x201D; to accept
            and project the elite&#x2019;s mystical view of itself and
            exaggerates its breadth and force in society. However, that the
            <em>Times</em> even would care to make the statement made by these
            two articles suggests minimally that the elite has been integrated
            into the corporate marketing strategy on an equal basis.<a

            Jordan even contends that radical culturalism was most susceptible
            among all the 1960s oppositional forms to the logic of
            commodification because of its tendency to reduce identity to the
            artifact. See &#x201C;Cultural Nationalism in the Sixties.&#x201D;<a

            The coalition&#x2019;s bankruptcy was demonstrated by the defections
            from its electoral constituency to Nixon&#x2019;s &#x201C;silent
            majority&#x201D; in 1968 and wholesale collapse in the face of
            McGovernite and Republican challenges in 1972. Unable to end the
            Vietnam War and adjust to a new era of imperialism, or to address
            the concerns of such post-scarcity era advocacy centers as the
            student and ecology movements, the productivist liberal-labor forces
            who had controlled the Democratic Party for a generation also found
            it impossible to establish a common discursive arena with the ethnic
            and feminist consciousness movements of the 1960s.<a

            which it demands in principle is this passive acceptance, which in

            A recent incident captures contemporary life: during the national
            telecast of the 1978 Miss Black America pageant, General Motors, a
            sponsor of the broadcast, featured a commercial in which a
            utility-man at a plant listed the attractions of his job. Among them
            were pay, fringe benefits, security, opportunity to perform various
            tasks (a function solely of his particular position), congenial
            supervision and a good union! In the metaphor of a colleague who is
            one of a vanishing breed of baseball fans, the bourgeoisie has a
            shut-out going with two away in the bottom of the ninth!<a

            &#x201C;The main thing is that utopian conscience and knowledge,
            through the pain it suffers in facts, grows wise, yet does not grow
            to full wisdom. It is <em>rectified</em>&#x2014;but never
            <em>refuted</em>&#x2014;by the mere power of that which, at any
            particular time, <em>is</em>. On the contrary it confutes and judges
            the existent if it is failing, and failing inhumanly; indeed, first
            and foremost it provides the <em>standard</em> to measure such
            facticity precisely as departure from the Right.&#x201D; Ernst
