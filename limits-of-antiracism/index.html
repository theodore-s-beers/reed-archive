        Antiracism is a favorite concept on the American left these days. Of
        course, all good sorts want to be against racism, but what does the word
        mean exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
        The contemporary discourse of &#x201C;antiracism&#x201D; is focused much
        more on taxonomy than politics. It emphasizes the name by which we
        should call some strains of inequality&#x2014;whether they should be
        broadly recognized as evidence of &#x201C;racism&#x201D;&#x2014;over
        specifying the mechanisms that produce them or even the steps that can
        be taken to combat them. And, no, neither &#x201C;overcoming
        racism&#x201D; nor &#x201C;rejecting whiteness&#x201D; qualifies as such
        a step any more than does waiting for the &#x201C;revolution&#x201D; or
        urging God&#x2019;s heavenly intervention. If organizing a rally against
        racism seems at present to be a more substantive political act than
        attending a prayer vigil for world peace, that&#x2019;s only because
        contemporary antiracist activists understand themselves to be employing
        the same tactics and pursuing the same ends as their predecessors in the
        period of high insurgency in the struggle against racial segregation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This view, however, is mistaken. The postwar activism that reached its
        crescendo in the South as the &#x201C;civil rights movement&#x201D;
        wasn&#x2019;t a movement against a generic &#x201C;racism&#x201D;; it
        was specifically and explicitly directed toward full citizenship rights
        for black Americans and against the system of racial segregation that
        defined a specific regime of explicitly racial subordination in the
        South. The 1940s March on Washington Movement was also directed against
        specific targets, like employment discrimination in defense production.
        Black Power era and post-Black Power era struggles similarly focused on
        combating specific inequalities and pursuing specific goals like the
        effective exercise of voting rights and specific programs of
        redistribution.
      </p>
      <h2>Clarity lost</h2>
      <p>
        Whether or not one considers those goals correct or appropriate, they
        were clear and strategic in a way that &#x201C;antiracism&#x201D; simply
        is not. Sure, those earlier struggles relied on a discourse of racial
        justice, but their targets were concrete and strategic. It is only in a
        period of political demobilization that the historical specificities of
        those struggles have become smoothed out of sight in a romantic idealism
        that homogenizes them into timeless abstractions like &#x201C;the black
        liberation movement&#x201D;&#x2014;an entity that, like Brigadoon,
        sporadically appears and returns impelled by its own logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ironically, as the basis for a politics, antiracism seems to reflect,
        several generations downstream, the victory of the postwar psychologists
        in depoliticizing the critique of racial injustice by shifting its focus
        from the social structures that generate and reproduce racial inequality
        to an ultimately individual, and ahistorical, domain of
        &#x201C;prejudice&#x201D; or &#x201C;intolerance.&#x201D; (No doubt this
        shift was partly aided by political imperatives associated with the Cold
        War and domestic anticommunism.) Beryl Satter&#x2019;s recent book on
        the racialized political economy of &#x201C;contract buying&#x201D; in
        Chicago in the 1950s and 1960s,

        industry in creating and recreating housing segregation and
        ghettoization.
      </p>
      <h2>Tasty bunny</h2>
      <p>
        All too often, &#x201C;racism&#x201D; is the subject of sentences that
        imply intentional activity or is characterized as an autonomous
        &#x201C;force.&#x201D; In this kind of formulation,
        &#x201C;racism,&#x201D; a conceptual abstraction, is imagined as a
        material entity. Abstractions can be useful, but they shouldn&#x2019;t
        be given independent life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can appreciate such formulations as transient political rhetoric;
        hyperbolic claims made in order to draw attention and galvanize opinion
        against some particular injustice. But as the basis for social
        interpretation, and particularly interpretation directed toward
        strategic political action, they are useless. Their principal function
        is to feel good and tastily righteous in the mouths of those who
        propound them. People do things that reproduce patterns of racialized
        inequality, sometimes with self-consciously bigoted motives, sometimes
        not. Properly speaking, however, &#x201C;racism&#x201D; itself
        doesn&#x2019;t do anything more than the Easter Bunny does.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, racism exists, as a conceptual condensation of practices and ideas
        that reproduce, or seek to reproduce, hierarchy along lines defined by
        race. Apostles of antiracism&#xA0;frequently can&#x2019;t hear this sort
        of statement, because in their exceedingly simplistic version of the
        nexus of race and injustice there can be only the Manichean dichotomy of
        those who admit racism&#x2019;s existence and those who deny it. There
        can be only Todd Gitlin (the sociologist and former SDS leader who has
        become, both fairly and as caricature, the symbol of a
        &#x201C;class-first&#x201D; line) and their own heroic, truth-telling
        selves, and whoever is not the latter must be the former. Thus the logic
        of straining to assign guilt by association substitutes for argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        My position is&#x2014;and I can&#x2019;t count the number of times
        I&#x2019;ve said this bluntly, yet to no avail, in response to those in
        blissful thrall of the comforting Manicheanism&#x2014;that of course
        racism persists, in all the disparate, often unrelated kinds of social
        relations and &#x201C;attitudes&#x201D; that are characteristically
        lumped together under that rubric, but from the standpoint of trying to
        figure out how to combat even what most of us would agree is racial
        inequality and injustice, that acknowledgement and $2.25 will get me a
        ride on the subway. It doesn&#x2019;t lend itself to any particular
        action except more taxonomic argument about what counts as racism.
      </p>
      <h2>Do what now?</h2>
      <p>
        And here&#x2019;s a practical catch-22. In the logic of antiracism,
        exposure of the racial element of an instance of wrongdoing will lead to
        recognition of injustice, which in turn will lead to remedial
        action&#x2014;though not much attention seems ever given to how this
        part is supposed to work. I suspect this is because the exposure part,
        which feels so righteously yet undemandingly good, is the real focus.
        But this exposure convinces only those who are already disposed to
        recognize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who aren&#x2019;t so disposed have multiple layers of obfuscating
        ideology, mainly forms of victim-blaming, through which to deny that a
        given disparity stems from racism or for that matter is even unjust. The
        Simi Valley jury&#x2019;s reaction to the Rodney King tape, which saw
        King as perp and the cops as victims, is a classic illustration. So is
        &#x201C;underclass&#x201D; discourse. Victimization by subprime mortgage
        scams can be, and frequently is, dismissed as the fault of irresponsible
        poor folks aspiring beyond their means. And there is no shortage of
        black people in the public eye&#x2014;Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey are
        two prime examples, as is Barack Obama&#x2014;who embrace and recycle
        those narratives of poor black Americans&#x2019; wayward behavior and
        self-destructive habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        And how does a simple narrative of &#x201C;racism&#x201D; account for
        the fact that so many black institutions, including churches and some
        racial advocacy organizations, and many, many black individuals actively
        promoted those risky mortgages as making the &#x201C;American Dream of
        home ownership&#x201D; possible for &#x201C;us&#x201D;? Sure, there are
        analogies available&#x2014;black slave traders, slave snitches,
        &#x201C;Uncle Toms&#x201D; and various race traitors&#x2014;but those
        analogies are moral judgments, not explanations. And to mention them
        only opens up another second-order debate about racial
        authenticity&#x2014;about who &#x201C;really&#x201D; represents the
        black community. Even Clarence Thomas sees himself as a proud black man
        representing the race&#x2019;s best interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        My point is that it&#x2019;s more effective politically to challenge the
        inequality and injustice directly and bypass the debate over whether it
        should be called &#x201C;racism.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        I do recognize that, partly because of the terms on which the civil
        rights movement&#x2019;s victories have been achieved, there is a strong
        practical imperative for stressing the racially invidious aspects of
        injustices: they have legal remedies. Race is one of the legal classes
        protected by anti-discrimination law; poverty, for instance, is not. But
        this makes identifying &#x201C;racism&#x201D; a technical requirement
        for pursuing certain grievances, not the basis of an overall political
        strategy for pursuit of racial justice, or, as I believe is a clearer
        left formulation, racial equality as an essential component of a program
        of social justice.
      </p>
      <h2>Anti-Marx</h2>
      <p>
        I&#x2019;ve been struck by the level of visceral and vitriolic
        anti-Marxism I&#x2019;ve seen from this strain of defenders of
        antiracism as a politics. It&#x2019;s not clear to me what drives it
        because it takes the form of snide dismissals than direct arguments.
        Moreover, the dismissals typically include empty acknowledgment that
        &#x201C;of course we should oppose capitalism,&#x201D; whatever that
        might mean. In any event, the tenor of this anti-Marxism is reminiscent
        of those right-wing discourses, many of which masqueraded as liberal, in
        which only invoking the word &#x201C;Marxism&#x201D; was sufficient to
        dismiss an opposing argument or position.
      </p>
      <p>
        This anti-Marxism has some curious effects. Leading professional
        antiracist Tim Wise
        <a

          >came to the defense</a
        >
        of Obama&#x2019;s purged green jobs czar Van Jones by dismissing
        Jones&#x2019;s &#x201C;brief stint with a pseudo-Maoist group,&#x201D;
        and pointing instead to &#x201C;his more recent break with such groups
        and philosophies, in favor of a commitment to eco-friendly, sustainable
        capitalism.&#x201D; In fact, Jones was a core member of a revolutionary
        organization, STORM, that took itself very seriously,
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.slideshare.net/tradeequity/storm-summation/"
          >almost comically so</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        And are we to applaud his break with radical politics in favor of a
        style of capitalism that few actual capitalists embrace? This is the
        substance of Wise&#x2019;s defense.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sort of thing only deepens my suspicions about antiracism&#x2019;s
        status within the comfort zone of neoliberalism&#x2019;s discourses of
        &#x201C;reform.&#x201D; More to the point, I suspect as well that this
        vitriol toward radicalism is rooted partly in the conviction that a left
        politics based on class analysis and one focused on racial injustice are
        Manichean alternatives.
      </p>
      <h2>Devolutions</h2>
      <p>
        This is also a notion of fairly recent provenance, in part as well
        another artifact of the terms on which the civil rights victories were
        consolidated, including the emergence of a fully incorporated black
        political class in the 1970s and its subsequent evolution. By contrast,
        examining, for example, the contributions to historian and civil rights
        activist Rayford Logan&#x2019;s 1944 volume
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Negro-African-American-Intellectual-Heritage/dp/0268019665/"
          ><em>What the Negro Wants</em></a
        >, one sees quite a different picture. Nearly all the
        contributors&#x2014;including nominal conservatives&#x2014;to this
        collection of analyses from a broad cross section of black scholars and
        activists asserted in very concrete terms that the struggle for racial
        justice and the general struggle for social and industrial democracy
        were more than inseparable, that the victory of the former largely
        depended on the success of the latter. This was, at the time, barely
        even a matter for debate: rather, it was the frame of reference for any
        black mass politics and protest activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I suggest above, various pressures of the postwar
        period&#x2014;including carrots of success and sticks of intimidation
        and witch-hunting, as well as the articulation of class tensions within
        the Civil Rights movement itself&#x2014;drove an evolution away from
        this perspective and toward reformulation of the movement&#x2019;s goals
        along lines more consonant with postwar, post-New Deal, Cold War
        liberalism. Thus what the political scientist Preston Smith calls
        &#x201C;<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Radio_1.html#081204"
          >racial democracy</a
        >&#x201D; came gradually to replace social democracy as a political
        goal&#x2014;the redress of grievances that could be construed as
        specifically racial took precedence over the redistribution of wealth,
        and an individualized psychology replaced notions of reworking the
        material sphere. This dynamic intensified with the combination of
        popular demobilization in black politics and emergence of the
        post-segregation black political class in the 1970s and 1980s.
      </p>
      <p>
        We live under a regime now that is capable simultaneously of including
        black people and Latinos, even celebrating that inclusion as a
        fulfillment of democracy, while excluding poor people without a whimper
        of opposition. Of course, those most visible in the excluded class are
        disproportionately black and Latino, and that fact gives the lie to the
        celebration. Or does it really? From the standpoint of a neoliberal
        ideal of equality&#x2014;in which classification by race, gender, sexual
        orientation or any other recognized ascriptive status (that is, status
        based on what one allegedly <em>is</em> rather than what one does) does
        not impose explicit, intrinsic or necessary limitations on one&#x2019;s
        participation and aspirations in the society&#x2014;this celebration of
        inclusion of blacks, Latinos and others is warranted.
      </p>
      <h2>We&#x2019;ll be back!</h2>
      <p>
        But this notion of democracy is inadequate, since it doesn&#x2019;t
        begin to address the deep and deepening patterns of inequality and
        injustice embedded in the ostensibly &#x201C;neutral&#x201D; dynamics of
        American capitalism. What A. Philip Randolph and others&#x2014;even
        anticommunists like Roy Wilkins&#x2014;understood in the 1940s is that
        what racism meant was that, so long as such dynamics persisted without
        challenge, black people and other similarly stigmatized populations
        would be clustered on the bad side of the distribution of costs and
        benefits. To extrapolate anachronistically to the present, they would
        have understood that the struggle against racial health disparities, for
        example, has no real chance of success apart from a struggle to
        eliminate for-profit health care.
      </p>
      <p>
        These seem really transparent points to me, but maybe that&#x2019;s just
        me. I remain curious why the &#x201C;debate&#x201D; over antiracism as a
        politics takes such indirect and evasive forms&#x2014;like the
        analogizing and guilt by association, moralistic bombast in lieu of
        concrete argument&#x2014;and why it persists in establishing, even often
        while denying the move, the terms of debate as race vs.&#xA0;class.
        I&#x2019;m increasingly convinced that a likely reason is that the race
        line is itself a class line, one that is entirely consistent with the
        neoliberal redefinition of equality and democracy. It reflects the
        social position of those positioned to benefit from the view that the
        market is a just, effective, or even acceptable system for rewarding
        talent and virtue and punishing their opposites and that, therefore,
        removal of &#x201C;artificial&#x201D; impediments to its functioning
        like race and gender will make it even more efficient and just.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this perspective even the &#x201C;left&#x201D; antiracist line that
        we must fight both economic inequality and racial inequality, which
        seems always in practice to give priority to &#x201C;fighting
        racism&#x201D; (often theorized as a necessary precondition for doing
        anything else), looks suspiciously like only another version of the
        evasive &#x201C;we&#x2019;ll come back for you&#x201D; (after we do all
        the business-friendly stuff) politics that the Democrats have so
        successfully employed to avoid addressing economic injustice.
