        Antiracism is a favorite concept on the American left these days. Of
        course, all good sorts want to be against racism, but what does the word
        mean exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
        The contemporary discourse of “antiracism” is focused much more on
        taxonomy than politics. It emphasizes the name by which we should call
        some strains of inequality—whether they should be broadly recognized as
        evidence of “racism”—over specifying the mechanisms that produce them or
        even the steps that can be taken to combat them. And, no, neither
        “overcoming racism” nor “rejecting whiteness” qualifies as such a step
        any more than does waiting for the “revolution” or urging God’s heavenly
        intervention. If organizing a rally against racism seems at present to
        be a more substantive political act than attending a prayer vigil for
        world peace, that’s only because contemporary antiracist activists
        understand themselves to be employing the same tactics and pursuing the
        same ends as their predecessors in the period of high insurgency in the
        struggle against racial segregation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This view, however, is mistaken. The postwar activism that reached its
        crescendo in the South as the “civil rights movement” wasn’t a movement
        against a generic “racism”; it was specifically and explicitly directed
        toward full citizenship rights for black Americans and against the
        system of racial segregation that defined a specific regime of
        explicitly racial subordination in the South. The 1940s March on
        Washington Movement was also directed against specific targets, like
        employment discrimination in defense production. Black Power era and
        post-Black Power era struggles similarly focused on combating specific
        inequalities and pursuing specific goals like the effective exercise of
        voting rights and specific programs of redistribution.
      </p>
      <h2>Clarity lost</h2>
      <p>
        Whether or not one considers those goals correct or appropriate, they
        were clear and strategic in a way that “antiracism” simply is not. Sure,
        those earlier struggles relied on a discourse of racial justice, but
        their targets were concrete and strategic. It is only in a period of
        political demobilization that the historical specificities of those
        struggles have become smoothed out of sight in a romantic idealism that
        homogenizes them into timeless abstractions like “the black liberation
        movement”—an entity that, like Brigadoon, sporadically appears and
        returns impelled by its own logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ironically, as the basis for a politics, antiracism seems to reflect,
        several generations downstream, the victory of the postwar psychologists
        in depoliticizing the critique of racial injustice by shifting its focus
        from the social structures that generate and reproduce racial inequality
        to an ultimately individual, and ahistorical, domain of “prejudice” or
        “intolerance.” (No doubt this shift was partly aided by political
        imperatives associated with the Cold War and domestic anticommunism.)
        Beryl Satter’s recent book on the racialized political economy of
        “contract buying” in Chicago in the 1950s and 1960s,
        <a

          ><em>American Babylon</em></a
        >, is another. Both make abundantly clear the role of the real estate
        industry in creating and recreating housing segregation and
        ghettoization.
      </p>
      <h2>Tasty bunny</h2>
      <p>
        All too often, “racism” is the subject of sentences that imply
        intentional activity or is characterized as an autonomous “force.” In
        this kind of formulation, “racism,” a conceptual abstraction, is
        imagined as a material entity. Abstractions can be useful, but they
        shouldn’t be given independent life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can appreciate such formulations as transient political rhetoric;
        hyperbolic claims made in order to draw attention and galvanize opinion
        against some particular injustice. But as the basis for social
        interpretation, and particularly interpretation directed toward
        strategic political action, they are useless. Their principal function
        is to feel good and tastily righteous in the mouths of those who
        propound them. People do things that reproduce patterns of racialized
        inequality, sometimes with self-consciously bigoted motives, sometimes
        not. Properly speaking, however, “racism” itself doesn’t do anything
        more than the Easter Bunny does.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, racism exists, as a conceptual condensation of practices and ideas
        that reproduce, or seek to reproduce, hierarchy along lines defined by
        race. Apostles of antiracism frequently can’t hear this sort of
        statement, because in their exceedingly simplistic version of the nexus
        of race and injustice there can be only the Manichean dichotomy of those
        who admit racism’s existence and those who deny it. There can be only
        Todd Gitlin (the sociologist and former SDS leader who has become, both
        fairly and as caricature, the symbol of a “class-first” line) and their
        own heroic, truth-telling selves, and whoever is not the latter must be
        the former. Thus the logic of straining to assign guilt by association
        substitutes for argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        My position is—and I can’t count the number of times I’ve said this
        bluntly, yet to no avail, in response to those in blissful thrall of the
        comforting Manicheanism—that of course racism persists, in all the
        disparate, often unrelated kinds of social relations and “attitudes”
        that are characteristically lumped together under that rubric, but from
        the standpoint of trying to figure out how to combat even what most of
        us would agree is racial inequality and injustice, that acknowledgement
        and $2.25 will get me a ride on the subway. It doesn’t lend itself to
        any particular action except more taxonomic argument about what counts
        as racism.
      </p>
      <h2>Do what now?</h2>
      <p>
        And here’s a practical catch-22. In the logic of antiracism, exposure of
        the racial element of an instance of wrongdoing will lead to recognition
        of injustice, which in turn will lead to remedial action—though not much
        attention seems ever given to how this part is supposed to work. I
        suspect this is because the exposure part, which feels so righteously
        yet undemandingly good, is the real focus. But this exposure convinces
        only those who are already disposed to recognize.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who aren’t so disposed have multiple layers of obfuscating
        ideology, mainly forms of victim-blaming, through which to deny that a
        given disparity stems from racism or for that matter is even unjust. The
        Simi Valley jury’s reaction to the Rodney King tape, which saw King as
        perp and the cops as victims, is a classic illustration. So is
        “underclass” discourse. Victimization by subprime mortgage scams can be,
        and frequently is, dismissed as the fault of irresponsible poor folks
        aspiring beyond their means. And there is no shortage of black people in
        the public eye—Bill Cosby and Oprah Winfrey are two prime examples, as
        is Barack Obama—who embrace and recycle those narratives of poor black
        Americans’ wayward behavior and self-destructive habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        And how does a simple narrative of “racism” account for the fact that so
        many black institutions, including churches and some racial advocacy
        organizations, and many, many black individuals actively promoted those
        risky mortgages as making the “American Dream of home ownership”
        possible for “us”? Sure, there are analogies available—black slave
        traders, slave snitches, “Uncle Toms” and various race traitors—but
        those analogies are moral judgments, not explanations. And to mention
        them only opens up another second-order debate about racial
        authenticity—about who “really” represents the black community. Even
        Clarence Thomas sees himself as a proud black man representing the
        race’s best interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        My point is that it’s more effective politically to challenge the
        inequality and injustice directly and bypass the debate over whether it
        should be called “racism.”
      </p>
      <p>
        I do recognize that, partly because of the terms on which the civil
        rights movement’s victories have been achieved, there is a strong
        practical imperative for stressing the racially invidious aspects of
        injustices: they have legal remedies. Race is one of the legal classes
        protected by anti-discrimination law; poverty, for instance, is not. But
        this makes identifying “racism” a technical requirement for pursuing
        certain grievances, not the basis of an overall political strategy for
        pursuit of racial justice, or, as I believe is a clearer left
        formulation, racial equality as an essential component of a program of
        social justice.
      </p>
      <h2>Anti-Marx</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve been struck by the level of visceral and vitriolic anti-Marxism
        I’ve seen from this strain of defenders of antiracism as a politics.
        It’s not clear to me what drives it because it takes the form of snide
        dismissals than direct arguments. Moreover, the dismissals typically
        include empty acknowledgment that “of course we should oppose
        capitalism,” whatever that might mean. In any event, the tenor of this
        anti-Marxism is reminiscent of those right-wing discourses, many of
        which masqueraded as liberal, in which only invoking the word “Marxism”
        was sufficient to dismiss an opposing argument or position.
      </p>
      <p>
        This anti-Marxism has some curious effects. Leading professional
        antiracist Tim Wise
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="http://www.timwise.org/2009/09/the-afrikaner-party-draws-first-blood-van-jones-barack-obama-and-the-audacity-of-capitulation/"
          >came to the defense</a
        >
        of Obama’s purged green jobs czar Van Jones by dismissing Jones’s “brief
        stint with a pseudo-Maoist group,” and pointing instead to “his more
        recent break with such groups and philosophies, in favor of a commitment
        to eco-friendly, sustainable capitalism.” In fact, Jones was a core
        member of a revolutionary organization, STORM, that took itself very
        seriously,
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.slideshare.net/tradeequity/storm-summation/"
          >almost comically so</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        And are we to applaud his break with radical politics in favor of a
        style of capitalism that few actual capitalists embrace? This is the
        substance of Wise’s defense.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sort of thing only deepens my suspicions about antiracism’s status
        within the comfort zone of neoliberalism’s discourses of “reform.” More
        to the point, I suspect as well that this vitriol toward radicalism is
        rooted partly in the conviction that a left politics based on class
        analysis and one focused on racial injustice are Manichean alternatives.
      </p>
      <h2>Devolutions</h2>
      <p>
        This is also a notion of fairly recent provenance, in part as well
        another artifact of the terms on which the civil rights victories were
        consolidated, including the emergence of a fully incorporated black
        political class in the 1970s and its subsequent evolution. By contrast,
        examining, for example, the contributions to historian and civil rights
        activist Rayford Logan’s 1944 volume
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.amazon.com/Negro-African-American-Intellectual-Heritage/dp/0268019665/"
          ><em>What the Negro Wants</em></a
        >, one sees quite a different picture. Nearly all the
        contributors—including nominal conservatives—to this collection of
        analyses from a broad cross section of black scholars and activists
        asserted in very concrete terms that the struggle for racial justice and
        the general struggle for social and industrial democracy were more than
        inseparable, that the victory of the former largely depended on the
        success of the latter. This was, at the time, barely even a matter for
        debate: rather, it was the frame of reference for any black mass
        politics and protest activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I suggest above, various pressures of the postwar period—including
        carrots of success and sticks of intimidation and witch-hunting, as well
        as the articulation of class tensions within the Civil Rights movement
        itself—drove an evolution away from this perspective and toward
        reformulation of the movement’s goals along lines more consonant with
        postwar, post-New Deal, Cold War liberalism. Thus what the political
        scientist Preston Smith calls “<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Radio_1.html#081204"
          >racial democracy</a
        >” came gradually to replace social democracy as a political goal—the
        redress of grievances that could be construed as specifically racial
        took precedence over the redistribution of wealth, and an individualized
        psychology replaced notions of reworking the material sphere. This
        dynamic intensified with the combination of popular demobilization in
        black politics and emergence of the post-segregation black political
        class in the 1970s and 1980s.
      </p>
      <p>
        We live under a regime now that is capable simultaneously of including
        black people and Latinos, even celebrating that inclusion as a
        fulfillment of democracy, while excluding poor people without a whimper
        of opposition. Of course, those most visible in the excluded class are
        disproportionately black and Latino, and that fact gives the lie to the
        celebration. Or does it really? From the standpoint of a neoliberal
        ideal of equality—in which classification by race, gender, sexual
        orientation or any other recognized ascriptive status (that is, status
        based on what one allegedly <em>is</em> rather than what one does) does
        not impose explicit, intrinsic or necessary limitations on one’s
        participation and aspirations in the society—this celebration of
        inclusion of blacks, Latinos and others is warranted.
      </p>
      <h2>We’ll be back!</h2>
      <p>
        But this notion of democracy is inadequate, since it doesn’t begin to
        address the deep and deepening patterns of inequality and injustice
        embedded in the ostensibly “neutral” dynamics of American capitalism.
        What A. Philip Randolph and others—even anticommunists like Roy
        Wilkins—understood in the 1940s is that what racism meant was that, so
        long as such dynamics persisted without challenge, black people and
        other similarly stigmatized populations would be clustered on the bad
        side of the distribution of costs and benefits. To extrapolate
        anachronistically to the present, they would have understood that the
        struggle against racial health disparities, for example, has no real
        chance of success apart from a struggle to eliminate for-profit health
        care.
      </p>
      <p>
        These seem really transparent points to me, but maybe that’s just me. I
        remain curious why the “debate” over antiracism as a politics takes such
        indirect and evasive forms—like the analogizing and guilt by
        association, moralistic bombast in lieu of concrete argument—and why it
        persists in establishing, even often while denying the move, the terms
        of debate as race vs. class. I’m increasingly convinced that a likely
        reason is that the race line is itself a class line, one that is
        entirely consistent with the neoliberal redefinition of equality and
        democracy. It reflects the social position of those positioned to
        benefit from the view that the market is a just, effective, or even
        acceptable system for rewarding talent and virtue and punishing their
        opposites and that, therefore, removal of “artificial” impediments to
        its functioning like race and gender will make it even more efficient
        and just.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this perspective even the “left” antiracist line that we must fight
        both economic inequality and racial inequality, which seems always in
        practice to give priority to “fighting racism” (often theorized as a
        necessary precondition for doing anything else), looks suspiciously like
        only another version of the evasive “we’ll come back for you” (after we
        do all the business-friendly stuff) politics that the Democrats have so
        successfully employed to avoid addressing economic injustice.
