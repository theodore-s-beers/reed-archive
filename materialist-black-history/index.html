      <p>
        This rumination is sparked most immediately by reflection on the roiling
        debate within the academic left and the academic left dressed up as a
        political left that has taken shape since the 2016 election. The debate
        initially centered on how to interpret &#x201C;white working
        class&#x201D; support for Donald Trump, specifically, whether we should
        understand white people&#x2019;s votes for Trump generically as
        indicative of their essential commitments to racism, patriarchy,
        homophobia, nativism, transphobia, <em>etc</em>., or whether some of
        that vote should be understood as a consequence of Democratic
        liberals&#x2019; failure to address working people&#x2019;s concerns
        with economic insecurity, because of the Democrats&#x2019; commitments
        to the dynamics of neoliberalization that have intensified economic
        inequality across the board nationally and have undermined access to
        public goods and social supports for poor and working people generally.
        The practical stakes of that argument have to do with what strategic
        lessons &#x201C;progressives&#x201D; should draw from Trump&#x2019;s
        victory with eyes on the 2018 mid-term elections, 2020, and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        In early iterations of the debate, various antiracist commentators and
        official Democratic operatives and their propaganda apparatus at MSNBC,
        the <em>Root</em>, and elsewhere on the internet-chattering and posing
        left have insisted that Trump&#x2019;s victory exposed the extent to
        which a deep vein of white Americans of all classes (except maybe the
        &#x201C;woke&#x201D; elements of the urbane professional-managerial
        strata) are committed to &#x201C;white supremacy&#x201D; before and
        beyond all else. The strategic takeaway from that view is that those
        Trump voters&#x2014;even the estimated just under 7 million to just over
        9 million who had previously voted for Sanders and at least once for
        Obama<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>1</sup></a
        >&#x2014;are hopeless reactionaries and cannot be relied upon as
        potential allies because their deepest commitments are anti-egalitarian,
        that their support for Trump reflected anxiety over perceived loss of
        status in relation to nonwhites, women, immigrants or others.<a
          href="#fn2"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref2"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>2</sup></a
        >
        This conviction has underwritten a contention that the lesson from
        Trump&#x2019;s victory is that it&#x2019;s not practical, or moral (the
        two are difficult to distinguish in this argument) to focus on
        increasing economic inequality and intensifying upward redistribution as
        the basis for left political appeals and instead that the necessary
        strategy should center on intensified mobilization of nominally
        oppressed groups, mainly nonwhite, and women as a generic category on
        the basis of opposition to the disparate distribution of goods and bads
        in the society among groups so identified and in support of the
        principles of diversity as generally understood in left-of-center
        political discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the argument has progressed, a <em>de facto</em> alliance between
        ostensibly progressive identitarians and Wall Street Democrats has come
        together around asserting, along with Paul Krugman and others,<a
          href="#fn3"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref3"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>3</sup></a
        >
        that &#x201C;horizontal inequality&#x201D;&#x2014;<em>i.e.</em>,
        inequality between statistically defined racial/ethnic groups&#x2014;is
        a more important problem than &#x201C;vertical inequality,&#x201D;
        characterized as inequality between individuals and households. That
        distinction instructively makes class and class inequality disappear,
        which is consistent with the trajectory of American liberalism across
        the more than seven decades since the end of World War II. Moreover, in
        a sort of mission creep, opponents of what they decry as a
        &#x201C;class-first&#x201D; position increasingly have come to denounce
        any expressions of concern for economic inequality as in effect catering
        to white supremacy. This tendency, which Tour&#xE9; Reed has argued
        rests on a race-reductionism,<a
          href="#fn4"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref4"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>4</sup></a
        >
        has surfaced and spread within the newly revitalized Democratic
        Socialists of America (DSA), as even many among those who consider
        themselves socialists object to the organization&#x2019;s selection of
        Medicare for All as its key political campaign on the grounds that
        pursuit of decommodified health care for all is objectionable because
        doing so does not sufficiently center antiracist and anti-disparitarian
        agendas. I submit that there&#x2019;s clearly a problem when
        anti-socialism is defined as socialism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The race-reductionist argument is propelled by a combination of intense
        moral fervor and crude self-interest. I&#x2019;ve argued in 2018
        articles in <em>nonsite</em>, the <em>Baffler</em>, and
        <em>Dialectical Anthropology</em>, that, as it has evolved, the
        post-2016 debate has thrown into bold relief the class character of
        antiracist and other expressions of identity politics.<a
          href="#fn5"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref5"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>5</sup></a
        >
        That could be a salutary product of the controversy. It&#x2019;s good in
        this sort of debate for the mist of ideology to burn off and the
        material stakes involved to be clear and in the open. However, many
        people who have followed or even participated in the debates have not
        connected the dots to see that obvious point or to acknowledge its
        implications. One reason for failure to do so is summed up pithily in
        Upton Sinclair&#x2019;s quip, &#x201C;It is difficult to get a man to
        understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding
        it.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only would pursuit of an agenda focused on addressing
        &#x201C;horizontal inequality,&#x201D; if successful, disproportionately
        benefit upper-status, already well-off people&#x2014;as Walter Benn
        Michaels and I have noted tirelessly over the past decade at least, the
        reality of a standard of justice based on eliminating group disparities
        is that a society could be just if 1% of the population controlled 90%
        of the resources, so long as the one percent featured blacks, Hispanics,
        women, lesbians and gays, <em>etc</em>. in rough proportion to their
        representation in the general population; also, advocacy of defining the
        only meaningful inequality as disparities between groups is itself a
        career trajectory in the academy, as well as in the corporate, nonprofit
        and freelance commentary worlds. There&#x2019;s no point trying to
        communicate with those whose resistance stems from such material
        investment; no matter what their specific content, their responses to
        class critique always amount to the orderly Turkle&#x2019;s lament to
        McMurphy in
        <em>One Flew over the Cuckoo&#x2019;s Nest</em>&#x2014;&#x201C;This is
        my fucking <em>job</em>!&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        Purblindness to identitarianism&#x2019;s ever more clearly exposed class
        character also rests on na&#xEF;vely habituated ideological thinking.
        Most of us operate with more or less vague or inchoate recognition that
        the past included bad old-timey times marked by openly racist practices
        like slavery and compulsory racial segregation, genocide against Native
        Americans, Chinese Exclusion, imposed gender hierarchies, <em>etc</em>.
        In lieu of examining the discrete sources of inequality in the present,
        antiracist ideology in particular depends on asserting superficial
        analogies to those earlier historical periods when racial exclusion and
        discrimination were more direct impediments to black Americans&#x2019;
        and other nonwhites&#x2019; social position and well-being. Thus, for
        example, Michelle Alexander proposes that contemporary mass
        incarceration be understood as a &#x201C;new Jim Crow&#x201D;<a
          href="#fn6"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref6"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>6</sup></a
        >&#x2014;though even she allows that the analogy doesn&#x2019;t
        work&#x2014;and expressions of outrage at miscarriages of justice in the
        present commonly allude to practices associated with slavery or the
        segregation era.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I have argued, such assertions are not to be taken literally as
        empirical claims; they are rhetorical. No sane or at all knowledgeable
        person can believe that black Americans live under similarly constrained
        and perilous conditions as they did a century ago or longer. Those
        analogies and allusions carry a silent preface: &#x201C;(This
        incident/phenomenon/pattern makes it seem as though) Nothing has
        changed.&#x201D; Yet the claim itself presumes that things have changed
        because the charge is essentially a denunciation of objectionable
        conditions or incidents in the present as atavistic and a call for
        others to regard them as such. Attempting to mobilize outrage about some
        action or expression through associating it with discredited or vilified
        views or practices is a common gambit in hortatory political rhetoric,
        more or less effective for a rally or leaflet. But this antiracist
        politics is ineffective and even destructive when it takes the place of
        scholarly interpretation or strategic political analysis.<a

        Political controversies in contemporary New Orleans provide an apt frame
        of reference for demonstrating antiracism&#x2019;s limitations, and
        class character, as a politics. Antiracist political critique failed
        abysmally after Katrina to mobilize significant opposition to
        elimination of low-income public housing or to the ongoing destruction
        of public schools. In a context in which black people participate as
        administrators, functionaries, contractors, and investors&#x2014;all in
        the bless&#xE8;d name of racial representation&#x2014;in the commercial
        opportunities provided by privatization and destruction of those
        institutions, that politics, which posits an abstract &#x201C;black
        community&#x201D; against an equally abstract &#x201C;racism,&#x201D;
        could not provide persuasive responses to the blend of underclass
        ideology that stigmatizes public housing as an incubator of a degraded
        population or that proffers culturalist explanations for failing
        schools.<a

        Debate over displacement for upscaling redevelopment, including
        proliferation of the Airbnb industry, is another powerful case in point
        in that city as elsewhere. In opting for a language of
        &#x201C;gentrification,&#x201D; opponents of displacement, often without
        necessarily intending to do so, cloud a simple, straightforward
        dynamic&#x2014;public support of private developers&#x2019; pursuit of
        rent-intensifying redevelopment&#x2014;with cultural implications that
        shift critique away from the issue of using public authority to engineer
        upward redistribution and impose hardship on relatively vulnerable
        residents. Instead, discussion of gentrification slides into objections
        about display of privilege, and lack of recognition or respect that,
        notwithstanding the moral outrage that accompanies them, accept the
        logic of rent-intensifying redevelopment as given and demand that
        newcomers acknowledge and honor aboriginal habitus and practices and
        that the &#x201C;community&#x201D; be involved in the processes of
        upgrading.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same racial or cultural discourse has unhelpfully shaped opposition
        to charterization of public education by focusing on the racial
        dimension of the process. The fundamental problem with Teach for America
        and the corporate privatizers for whom TFA are shock troops, after all,
        is not that the missionaries are mainly white and unfamiliar with native
        culture or even that many of them are tourists building extracurriculars
        for their graduate and professional school dossiers. Those are only
        idiosyncratically distasteful features of a particular line of attack on
        one front in a broader war on public goods and the idea of social
        solidarity, in line with marketization of all human needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that sort of culturalist discourse also opens opportunities for
        petty, and not so petty, entrepreneurship in the name of respect or
        recognition of the community, within the logic of neoliberalization.
        Race reductionism enables a sleight-of-hand in which benefits to
        individuals can appear to be victories for the generic racial population
        or community. The more deeply embedded a groupist notion of fairness or
        justice becomes as common sense, the more easily that sleight-of-hand
        works under labels like &#x201C;community empowerment,&#x201D;
        &#x201C;voice,&#x201D; &#x201C;opportunity,&#x201D; or
        &#x201C;representation&#x201D; to propel and legitimate accumulation by
        dispossession.<a

        This takes us back to Sinclair&#x2019;s dictum, which underlies the
        material truth of antiracist politics and other expressions of
        identitarianism that are hostile to politics based on class
        solidarities. Yet even the crudest self-interest depends on ideological
        mystification for legitimacy. And race/racism&#x2014;the former term is
        inconceivable without the latter&#x2014;has always worked in exactly
        that way; only now, in the aftermath of the victories of the 1960s, it
        can work to the benefit as well as the detriment of nonwhites. The
        cornerstone of race ideology, which is not now and never has been
        incompatible with capitalism, is presumption of ontological-level
        differences among human populations apportioned into racial groups. Just
        as nineteenth and early twentieth century white supremacists insisted
        that fundamental differences preempt political alliances based on common
        material conditions, antiracists posit whites&#x2019;
        transhistorical&#x2014;and thus primordial&#x2014;commitment to racial
        supremacy toward the same end.
      </p>
      <p>
        That&#x2019;s the more insidious basis of the impulse to argue for the
        primacy of race in contemporary politics via allusion to the past. Like
        all forms of race-reductionism it masks a class-skewed agenda. That
        underlying reality helps make sense both of why antiracists seem
        unconcerned that their elevation of challenging disparities to the
        paramount, if not exclusive, goal of egalitarian politics is entirely
        consistent with neoliberalism&#x2019;s regime of intensifying economic
        inequality and why their <em>de facto</em> alliance with corporate and
        Wall Street Democrats against the conventional left has been automatic
        and untroubling.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I&#x2019;ll conclude as I&#x2019;d initially intended to begin this
        rumination, with several postulates about black American political
        history to counter the idealist mystifications that posit a primordial
        white racism or a transhistorical, reified White Supremacy capable of
        acting in the world on the conviction that, as Nihkil Singh and Joshua
        Clover most recently characterized it in a Verso blogpost, &#x201C;black
        lives matter less.&#x201D;

          Slavery was fundamentally a labor relation, not an extreme system of
          race relations. To paraphrase Barbara and Karen Fields, its objective
          was to produce cotton, sugar, tobacco, and rice, not white supremacy.
          Its appeal to the planter class was that it secured a labor force that
          had no rights or recourse, not that it was a permanent sadistic camp.
          Historian Kenneth Stampp quotes a slaveowner&#x2019;s succinct
          explanation: &#x201C;For what purpose does the master hold the
          servant? Is it not that by his labor, he, the master, may accumulate
          wealth?&#x201D;<a

          An irony of the view that defines slavery as institutionalized
          brutality is its implication that slavery without extremes of
          brutalization might not be objectionable.

          The segregationist regime was a historically specific social order
          based on disfranchisement of the vast majority of blacks and a
          substantial percentage of whites, imposed by southern elites after
          defeat of the interracial Populist political insurgency in the late
          nineteenth century. It was defined by an extensive, legally codified
          system of racial subordination. That order was not fully consolidated
          before World War I, and its institutional foundations were crushed by
          the late 1960s. That is, it was a regime that prevailed for roughly
          sixty years, depending on location.

          There is no singular, transhistorical &#x201C;Black Liberation
          Struggle&#x201D; or &#x201C;Black Freedom Movement,&#x201D; and there
          never has been. Black Americans have engaged in many different forms
          of political expression in many different domains, around many
          different issues, both those considered racial and not. They have
          engaged in race-solidaristic formations and in close concert with
          others, in class-based and multiclass alliances. As Cedric Johnson has
          argued forcefully, contemporary scholarly discussion reads

          in which black Americans have engaged since Emancipation, which he
          describes as &#x201C;black American political life.&#x201D; Political
          differentiation has been as common among black Americans as among all
          others. Moreover, issues bearing specifically on race or racial
          disparities have never exhausted, or exclusively defined, black
          Americans&#x2019; expressed political concerns.

          As a corollary of 3, the issues driving the postwar southern mass
          mobilization against segregation and the emergent black interest-group
          urban politics in the North and West, and the big city South, were
          distinct. Lumping them together under a blanket construct like the
          &#x201C;long civil rights movement&#x201D; does not help us comprehend
          the discrete features of either or, more important, the distinct
          trajectories each set in motion.

          Black Power was not a mass, radical insurgent movement. It was a
          militant expression of ethnic pluralism. Radicals of various
          sorts&#x2014;including ideological race nationalists&#x2014;occupied
          its fringes, but the driving and commanding forces of Black Power
          politics were always the assertive elements within the new black
          political and professional-managerial class that emerged from
          opportunity structures opened by the victories of the Civil Rights
          movement, the dynamics of urban demographic transition and
          incorporation into governing regimes, and War on Poverty, Model
          Cities, and foundation-funded programs. Nominally radical groups, such
          as the Black Panther Party (BPP), the League of Revolutionary Black
          Workers, and others with less cachet among the left, were not serious
          alternatives, certainly not the romantic &#x201C;roads tragically not
          taken&#x201D; of post-New Left fantasies. General Baker, longtime
          United Auto Workers activist and co-founder of both the Dodge
          Revolutionary Union Movement (DRUM) and the League of Revolutionary
          Black Workers, was emphatically clear that those tendencies were
          entirely specific to Detroit and the centrality of the union in local
          Democratic politics. The BPP was founded in 1966, and by the end of
          the decade was already in disarray, especially outside Oakland, as a
          result of police repression, to be sure, but also of their political
          incoherence.

          Neither Malcolm X, Frantz Fanon, C.&#xA0;L.&#xA0;R. James, nor Stuart
          Hall can tell us anything strategically useful about the black
          American political situation. Appeals to their putative wisdom stem
          from academic leftists&#x2019; romantic attachments and commitments to
          race-reductionist politics. Malcolm was dead before nearly all the big
          events understood to define &#x201C;the Sixties&#x201D; had occurred.
          Fanon died several years before Malcolm, and in any case his focus was
          always elsewhere; he gave only the most general, perfunctory attention
          to the United States. James&#x2019;s time in the United States, as I
          have said, was on the political equivalent of a tourist visa. He was
          not enmeshed in black American politics and understood its internal
          and external dynamics in only an abstract, formalist way. The same
          pertains to Stuart Hall. Attachments to the likes of Malcolm, Fanon,
          James, and Hall are more totemic than intellectually or politically
          productive. There is a more pernicious aspect of embrace of those
          figures&#x2019; supposed cultural authority. Each is read as
          propounding trans-contextual insights about &#x201C;race.&#x201D; And
          such insights are necessarily race-reductionist.
