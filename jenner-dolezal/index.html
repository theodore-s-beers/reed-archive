        By far the most intellectually and politically interesting thing about
        the recent &#x201C;expos&#xE9;&#x201D; of Spokane, WA, NAACP activist
        Rachel Dolezal&#x2019;s racial status is the conundrum it has posed for
        racial identitarians who are also committed to defense of transgender
        identity. The comparisons between Dolezal and Republican Jenner
        (I&#x2019;ve decided to opt for that referent because it is an identity
        continuous between &#x201C;Bruce&#x201D; and &#x201C;Caitlyn&#x201D; and
        is moreover the one most meaningful to me) began almost instantly,
        particularly as a flood of mass-mediated Racial Voices who support the
        legitimacy of transgender identity objected strenuously to suggestions
        that Dolezal&#x2019;s representation, and apparent perception, of
        herself as black is similar to Bruce Jenner&#x2019;s perception of
        himself as actually Caitlyn. Their contention is that one kind of claim
        to an identity at odds with culturally constructed understandings of the
        identity appropriate to one&#x2019;s biology is okay, but that the other
        is not&#x2014;that it&#x2019;s okay to feel like a woman when you
        don&#x2019;t have the body of a woman and to act like (and even get
        yourself the body of) a woman, but that it&#x2019;s wrong to feel like a
        black person when you&#x2019;re actually white, and that acting like
        you&#x2019;re black and doing your best to get yourself the body of a
        black person is just lying.
      </p>
      <p>
        The way Zeba Blay puts it, on the Black Voices section of
        <em>HuffPo</em>, is by declaring how important it is to &#x201C;make one
        thing clear: transracial identity is not a thing.&#x201D; What is clear
        is that it&#x2019;s not at all clear what that statement is supposed to
        mean. It seems to suggest that transracial identity is not something
        that has been validated by public recognition, or at least that Blay has
        not heard of or does not recognize it. But there&#x2019;s an obvious
        problem with this contention. There was a moment, not that long ago
        actually, when transgender identity was not a &#x201C;thing&#x201D; in
        that sense, either. Is Blay&#x2019;s contention that we should accept
        transgender identity only because it is now publicly recognized? If so,
        the circularity is obvious, and the lack of acceptance arguably only a
        matter of time. Transgender wasn&#x2019;t always a thing&#x2014;<a

          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Jorgensen"
          >just ask Christine Jorgensen</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the more serious charge is the moral one, that, as Michelle Garcia
        puts it, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s pretty clear: Dolezal has lied.&#x201D; But
        here too, it&#x2019;s not clear what&#x2019;s so clear. Is the point
        supposed to be that Dolezal is lying when she says she identifies as
        black? Or is it that being black has nothing to do with how you
        identify? The problem with the first claim is obvious&#x2014;how do they
        know? And on what grounds does Jenner get to be telling the truth and
        Dolezal not? But the problem with the second claim is even more obvious,
        since if you think there&#x2019;s some biological fact of the matter
        about what race people actually belong to, utterly independent of what
        race they think they belong to, you&#x2019;re committed to a view of
        racial difference as biologically definitive in a way that&#x2019;s even
        deeper than sexual difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blay attempts to deal with these issues by quoting the analysis of
        Darnell L. Moore of <em>Mic</em>, that, &#x201C;In attempting to pass as
        black, Dolezal falsely represented her identity. Trans people
        don&#x2019;t lie about their gender identities&#x2014;they express their
        gender according to categories that reflect who they are.&#x201D; This
        claim has recurred in various formulations. Meredith Talusan
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/12/comparison-transgender-people-rachel-dolezal"
          >asserts it</a
        >
        most emphatically in the <em>Guardian</em>:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The fundamental difference between Dolezal&#x2019;s actions and trans
          people&#x2019;s is that her decision to identify as black was an
          active choice, whereas transgender people&#x2019;s decision to
          transition is almost always involuntary. Transitioning is the product
          of a fundamental aspect of our humanity&#x2014;gender&#x2014;being
          foisted upon us over and over again from the time of our birth in a
          manner inconsistent with our own experience of our genders. Doctors
          don&#x2019;t announce our race or color when we are born; they
          announce our gender. People who are alienated from their presumed
          gender and define themselves according to another gender have existed
          since earliest recorded history; race is a medieval European
          invention. Thus, Dolezal identified as black, but I am a woman, and
          other trans people are the gender they feel themselves to be.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        This assessment is mind-bogglingly wrong-headed, but it is at the same
        time thus deeply revealing of the contradictoriness and irrationality
        that undergird so much self-righteous identitarian twaddle. First of
        all, as I&#x2019;ve already suggested, the claim that Dolezal&#x2019;s
        identity is false and transgendered people&#x2019;s are true immediately
        provokes a &#x201C;Who says?&#x201D; What makes Talusan&#x2019;s and
        other transgender people&#x2019;s identities authentic is that they
        believe them to be authentic. We agree to accept transgender
        people&#x2019;s expression of belief in their authenticity. It&#x2019;s
        fine for Talusan or others to say that they are convinced that the
        identities they embrace are their real ones in some way that is not
        limited by their biology at birth. However, the logic of the pluralism
        and open-endedness of identity they assert would require that they also
        accept the self-reports of claims to authenticity regarding identities
        that may diverge in other ways from convention. Certainly, not doing so
        necessitates some justification more persuasive&#x2014;and less Archie
        Bunkerish&#x2014;than simply asserting, &#x201C;Mine is genuine, theirs
        is not.&#x201D; The voluntary/involuntary criterion isn&#x2019;t even
        sophistry; it&#x2019;s just bullshit. Once again, who says? Who gave
        Talusan, Moore, Blay and others the gifts of telepathic mindreading and
        ventriloquy? How do we know that Dolezal may not sense that she is
        &#x201C;really&#x201D; black in the same, involuntary way that many
        transgender people feel that they are &#x201C;really&#x201D;
        transgender?
      </p>
      <p>
        The related complaint that Dolezal&#x2019;s self-representation is
        inauthentic because she &#x201C;lied&#x201D; about her identity is
        equally fatuous. To stay within the identitarian paradigm, what did
        Republican Jenner do for more than six decades of operating as Bruce?
        What does any transgender person do before the moment of coming out?
      </p>
      <p>
        Michelle Garcia, also at <em>Mic</em>, asks, imagining that her question
        is a trump, &#x201C;If Caitlyn Jenner can identify as a woman, why
        can&#x2019;t Rachel Dolezal say that she&#x2019;s black?&#x201D; But why
        should that be the definitive criterion for accepting the
        self-representation? Who made that rule? Could there be something about
        public expectations at this point regarding the fixity of racial
        boundaries that would stay Dolezal from taking the bold step of
        announcing that she had always &#x201C;known&#x201D; herself to be
        black? The furor that has surrounded the &#x201C;expos&#xE9;&#x201D;
        would suggest that is the case. Would she have felt free to do so if
        public awareness already accepted the possibility of racial identity as
        not necessarily tied to official classification? I have no idea whether
        she would have, and Garcia doesn&#x2019;t either. And, again, what about
        the 60+ years before Republican Jenner emerged publicly as Caitlyn? Was
        his privately embraced identity as Caitlyn bogus for all those years
        because he didn&#x2019;t, or felt he couldn&#x2019;t, go public with it?
      </p>
      <p>
        This brings me to the most important point that this affair throws into
        relief. It has outed the essentialism on which those identitarian
        discourses rest. Garcia asks, &#x201C;So why don&#x2019;t we just accept
        Dolezal as black? Because she&#x2019;s not.&#x201D; But why is she not
        black in Garcia&#x2019;s view? Well, &#x201C;Her parents say
        she&#x2019;s not even close to being black.&#x201D; But what would that
        mean&#x2014;that she has no known black ancestry? Is blackness, then, a
        matter of hypodescent after all? But, if that&#x2019;s what it is, then
        what politically significant meaning does the category have? Dolezal no
        doubt has her issues and idiosyncrasies, but, especially if the judgment
        of the NAACP counts for anything in the matter, I&#x2019;m pretty sure
        I&#x2019;d take her in a trade for Clarence Thomas, Cory Booker, Condi
        Rice, and five TFA pimps to be named later. Or would Dolezal&#x2019;s
        &#x201C;not even close to being black&#x201D; mean that she was raised
        outside of &#x201C;authentic&#x201D; black idiom or cultural experience?
        But whose black idiom or cultural experience would that be? Is there
        really an irreducible, definitive one? If so, on which Racial Voice blog
        or Ivy League campus might we find it?
      </p>
      <p>
        The essentialism cuts in odd ways in this saga. Sometimes race is real
        in a way that sex is not&#x2014;you&#x2019;re black only if you meet the
        biological criteria (whatever they&#x2019;re supposed to be) for
        blackness. And sometimes, as in Talusan&#x2019;s failure to distinguish
        gender from sex typing, gender is &#x201C;real&#x201D; in a way that
        race is not. &#x201C;Doctors don&#x2019;t announce our race or color
        when we are born; they announce our gender.&#x201D; I assume Talusan is
        referring to the stereotypical moment in the delivery room. Technically,
        though, the doctor announces the child&#x2019;s sex type, not its
        culturally constructed gender roles. And when exactly does Talusan
        presume race is determined and by whom? I&#x2019;m pretty sure that in
        most of the United States it&#x2019;s still marked on one&#x2019;s birth
        certificate. That&#x2019;s not the delivery room, but it&#x2019;s pretty
        damn close.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talusan&#x2019;s confusion of sex and gender is startlingly na&#xEF;ve.
        She contends that gender is a &#x201C;product of a fundamental aspect of
        our humanity&#x201D; and that, unlike race, the medieval European
        invention, gender is a &#x201C;fundamental attribute&#x201D; of our
        existence. But gender is no less culturally constructed than race. If
        Talusan were a little more curious anthropologically than precocious,
        she might have noticed that the relation between sex type and gender
        roles has varied wildly over the history and range of our species. But
        she, like Jenner, Hugh Hefner, and legions of anti-feminists, among
        others, naturalizes gender as melded into sex type: &#x201C;Trans people
        transition in order to be the gender we feel inside.&#x201D; For those
        to whom it seems odd or tendentious to link the naturalizing discourses
        of some transgender activists and hoary anti-feminism, I recommend
        Elinor Burkett&#x2019;s fine rumination on the issue in the June 6
        [2015] <em>New York Times</em>, titled &#x201C;<a
          target="_blank"

      </p>
      <p>
        There is a guild-protective agenda underlying racial
        identitarians&#x2019; outrage about Dolezal that is also quite
        revealing. Nikki Lynette, writing at <em>Red Eye</em>,
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/redeye/redeye-naacp-rachel-dolezal-is-not-caitlyn-jenner-20150612-column.html"
          >exhorts</a
        >, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t Compare NAACP&#x2019;s Rachel Dolezal to Caitlyn
        Jenner.&#x201D; Why? Because, she contends, Dolezal benefited materially
        from her self-representation as black. Putting aside for the moment
        Republican Jenner&#x2019;s orchestrated payday surrounding the
        announcement and display of transition, this is an unusual charge, one
        that is counterintuitive in relation to several generations of black
        American humor and also smacks a bit of right-wingers&#x2019;
        insinuations about whites taking advantage of affirmative action.
        Nevertheless, like Zeba Blay and others, Lynette rehearses a charge that
        Dolezal received a full scholarship to the Howard University MFA program
        on the pretext that she was a black woman. That charge is false; not
        only was she not admitted as black person (Howard&#x2019;s applications
        apparently didn&#x2019;t require racial identification); reports from
        faculty and students when she was there confirmed that she was not
        understood to be black when she was enrolled at the university. (See
        Hillary Crosley Coker, &#x201C;<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://jezebel.com/when-rachel-dolezal-attended-howard-university-she-was-1710941472"
          >When Rachel Dolezal Attended Howard, She Was White</a
        >,&#x201D; at <em>Jezebel</em>.) The charge is what those making it want
        to be true; they assume it&#x2019;s true because they understand black
        racial classification as a form of capital.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blay expresses this position most clearly. She objects that Dolezal
        &#x201C;occupied positions of power specifically designated for members
        of a marginalized group.&#x201D; Blay is referring, in addition to the
        false accusation about the circumstances of Dolezal&#x2019;s
        matriculation at Howard, to her having belonged, while an undergraduate
        at Bellhaven College, to &#x201C;a racial reconciliation community
        development project where blacks and whites lived together.&#x201D; Blay
        presents membership in that group as though it were precursor to her
        having duped Howard out of a fellowship that should have gone to a black
        woman. To Blay this pattern of duplicity culminated in Dolezal&#x2019;s
        &#x201C;eventually working her way up to president of the Spokane NAACP
        in 2014.&#x201D; (Some have included a charge that Dolezal used racial
        misrepresentation to advance an academic career; an occasional stint as
        an adjunct instructor, however, doesn&#x2019;t square with the Iggy
        Azalea imagery that seems to propel this claim. It certainly would be a
        skimpy reward for such prodigious self-fashioning.) In Blay&#x2019;s
        narrow political universe, the NAACP branch presidency is an honorific
        to be awarded on the basis of ascriptive categories like race and
        gender, not the result of effective work on behalf of the
        Association&#x2019;s mission and goals. It is especially striking in
        this regard that a number of those exercised by Dolezal have at least
        implicitly called for the NAACP to renounce its support of her. Their
        commitment to arbitrary notions of racial propriety should override the
        Association&#x2019;s sense of its own concrete priorities in the actual
        struggle for civil rights and social justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        When all is said and done, the racial outrage is about protection of the
        boundaries of racial authenticity as the exclusive property of the guild
        of Racial Spokespersonship. (Blay also, with no hint of
        self-consciousness, complains that Dolezal&#x2019;s deception has
        &#x201C;hijacked the conversation about race, during a week where the
        nation was focusing on police brutality in McKinney, Texas.&#x201D; Not
        only is that insipid &#x201C;conversation about race&#x201D; chatter the
        equivalent of fingernails on a chalkboard. It seems that Blay
        hasn&#x2019;t discerned that the Dolezal issue has captured such
        attention only because it rankles the sensibilities of those who
        essentialize race and that no one is making her talk about it but
        herself.)

        That is to say, as is ever clearer and ever more important to note, race
        politics is not an alternative to class politics; it is a class
        politics, the politics of the left-wing of neoliberalism. It is the
        expression and active agency of a political order and moral economy in
        which capitalist market forces are treated as unassailable nature. An
        integral element of that moral economy is displacement of the critique
        of the invidious outcomes produced by capitalist class power onto
        equally naturalized categories of ascriptive identity that sort us into
        groups supposedly defined by what we essentially are rather than what we
        do. As I have argued, following Walter Michaels and others, within that
        moral economy a society in which 1% of the population controlled 90% of
        the resources could be just, provided that roughly 12% of the 1% were
        black, 12% were Latino, 50% were women, and whatever the appropriate
        proportions were LGBT people. It would be tough to imagine a normative
        ideal that expresses more unambiguously the social position of people
        who consider themselves candidates for inclusion in, or at least
        significant staff positions in service to, the ruling class.
      </p>
      <p>
        This perspective may help explain why, the more aggressively and openly
        capitalist class power destroys and marketizes every shred of social
        protection working people of all races, genders, and sexual orientations
        have fought for and won over the last century, the louder and more
        insistent are the demands from the identitarian left that we focus our
        attention on statistical disparities and episodic outrages that
        &#x201C;prove&#x201D; that the crucial injustices in the society should
        be understood in the language of ascriptive identity. The Dolezal/Jenner
        contretemps stoked the protectionist reflexes of identitarian
        spokesperson guilds because it troubles current jurisdictional
        boundaries. Even before that, however, some racial identitarians had
        grown bolder in laying bare the blur of careerism and arbitrary,
        self-serving moralism at the base of this supposed politics. In an
        unintentionally farcical homage to Black Power era radicalism, various
        racial ventriloquists claiming to channel the Voices of the Youth
        leadership of the putative Black Lives Matter &#x201C;movement&#x201D;
        have lately been arguing that the key condition for a left alliance is
        that we all must &#x201C;respect black leadership.&#x201D; Of course,
        that amounts to a claim to shut up and take whatever anyone who claims
        that status says or does. Those of us old enough to remember Black Power
        and the War on Poverty also will look around to see which funders or
        employers they&#x2019;re addressing.

        And, in apparent contradiction of the ontological principle of group
        authenticity on which the paradigm rests, reprise of the tawdriest
        features of Black Power hustling isn&#x2019;t available only to
        officially recognized people of color. Joan Walsh, apparently having

        the millions who would be helped by Sanders&#x2019;s social-democratic
        agenda, but Clinton, presumably, would show proper respect by hooking
        them up with a #BlackLivesMatter Facebook like.

        I&#x2019;ll conclude by returning to the Dolezal/Jenner issue. I can
        imagine an identitarian response to my argument to the effect that I
        endorse some version of wiggerism, or the view that &#x201C;feeling
        black&#x201D; can make one genuinely black. The fact is that I think
        that formulation is wrong-headed either way one lines up on it. Each
        position&#x2014;that one can feel or will one&#x2019;s way into an
        ascriptive identity or that one can&#x2019;t&#x2014;presumes that the
        &#x201C;identity&#x201D; is a thing with real boundaries. The issue of
        the line that Dolezal, who has now resigned her NAACP position, crossed
        that made her alleged self-representation unacceptable is interesting in
        this regard only because it highlights contradictions at the core of
        racial essentialism. In addition to the problems of articulating what
        confers racial authenticity, if what we have read about her approach to
        expressing black racial identity is accurate, she seems to have embraced
        an essentialist version of being black no less than do her outraged
        critics. Wiggers do so as well, and we must admit that Dolezal&#x2019;s
        performance and apparent embrace of culturally recognized
        representations of black womanhood rests on an &#xE6;sthetic purporting
        to embody respect and celebration rather than the demeaning racialist
        fantasies that shape the commercial personae of the likes of Iggy
        Azalea. Moreover, even if Dolezal may suffer from something like racial
        dysmorphia, the expression of her fixation has been tied up with
        commitment to struggle for social justice. She may have other personal
        problems and strained or bad relations with family members, but those
        are matters that concern her and those with whom she interacts. They do
        not automatically impeach the authenticity of her feelings of who she
        &#x201C;really&#x201D; is. And I doubt that we&#x2019;d want to start a
        scorecard comparing her and Republican Jenner on that front.
      </p>
      <p>
        That points to the other way that this affair has exposed
        identitarianism&#x2019;s irrational underbelly. The fundamental
        contradiction that has impelled the debate and required the flight into
        often idiotic sophistry is that racial identitarians assume, even if
        they give catechistic lip service&#x2014;a requirement of being taken
        seriously outside Charles Murray&#x2019;s world&#x2014;to the
        catchphrase that &#x201C;race is a social construction,&#x201D; that
        race is a thing, an essence that lives within us. If pushed, they will
        offer any of a range of more or less mystical, formulaic, breezy, or
        neo-Lamarckian faux explanations of how it can be both an essential
        ground of our being and a social construct, and most people are willing
        not to pay close attention to the justificatory patter. Nevertheless,
        for identitarians, to paraphrase Michaels, we aren&#x2019;t, for
        instance, black because we do black things; that seems to have been
        Dolezal&#x2019;s mistaken wish. We do black things because we are black.
        Doing black things does not make us black; being black makes us do black
        things. That is how it&#x2019;s possible to talk about having lost or
        needing to retrieve one&#x2019;s culture or define &#x201C;cultural
        appropriation&#x201D; as the equivalent, if not the prosaic reality, of
        a property crime. That, indeed, is also the essence of essentialism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem the Jenner comparison poses is that, if identity is inherent
        in us in ways that are beyond our volition, how can we legitimate
        transgender identity&#x2014;which is gender identity that does not
        conform with that conventionally associated with biological sex
        type&#x2014;without the psychological stigma of dysmorphia? Confounding
        of sex and gender is the ideological mechanism that seems to resolve
        that conundrum. Thus, notwithstanding my earlier suggestion that Talusan
        misses the cultural fluidity of gender because she is na&#xEF;ve
        anthropologically, she may also have an important ideological reason to
        deny it. It is only by treating gender roles as somehow endowed at birth
        that she can contend that transgender identity is &#x201C;almost always
        involuntary.&#x201D; That is, in the context of essentializing political
        discourse, gender identity must express a condition as
        &#x201C;natural&#x201D; or inherent equivalent, or prior, to biological
        sex type. Transgender identity requires being read as in effect
        &#x201C;hardwired&#x201D; only within a normative framework in which
        access to the domain of recognizable identity deserving of civic regard
        depends on essentialist claims, and the only way transgender identity
        can meet that standard is to collapse distinctions between sex and
        gender&#x2014;even though that move, as Burkett argues, cuts against the
        grain of the perspective the women&#x2019;s movement has fought to
        advance for at least the last half-century. Nor does this view
        acknowledge the grave political mischief that ideologies of essential
        human difference have underwritten in not-at-all distant history, from
        segregation and other forms legal discrimination and imposition of
        separate spheres to genocide.
      </p>
      <p>
        The transrace/transgender comparison makes clear the conceptual
        emptiness of the essentializing discourses, and the opportunist
        politics, that undergird identitarian ideologies. There is no coherent,
        principled defense of the stance that transgender identity is legitimate
        but transracial is not, at least not one that would satisfy basic rules
        of argument. The debate also throws into relief the reality that a
        notion of social justice that hinges on claims to entitlement based on
        extra-societal, ascriptive identities is neoliberalism&#x2019;s critical
        self-consciousness. In insisting on the political priority of such
        fictive, naturalized populations, identitarianism meshes well with
        neoliberal naturalization of the structures that reproduce inequality.
        In that sense it&#x2019;s not just a pointed coincidence that
        Dolezal&#x2019;s critics were appalled with the NAACP for standing
        behind her work. It may be that one of Rachel Dolezal&#x2019;s most
        important contributions to the struggle for social justice may turn out
        to be having catalyzed, not intentionally to be sure, a discussion that
        may help us move beyond the identitarian dead end.
