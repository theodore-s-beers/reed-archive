        During the Reagan era, ultraconservative columnist James Kilpatrick, a
        notorious segregationist since the southern
        <a

        against the 1954 <em>Brown</em> decision, took up the right-wing attack
        on Social Security from a novel angle. He opposed the program as
        discriminatory against African Americans because black men were
        statistically less likely than whites to live long enough to receive the
        old-age benefits. That was likely the only time in his public life
        Kilpatrick expressed anything that might seem like sympathy for black
        Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        A decade or so later, many advocates of the welfare “reform” that ended
        the federal government’s 60-year commitment to provide income support
        for the indigent similarly couched their efforts in feigned concern to
        help poor black people break a supposedly distinctive “cycle of
        poverty.” Similar disingenuous tears have accompanied the federal
        government’s retreat since the 1990s from direct provision of affordable
        housing for the poor. Thus, a racist premise that there’s a special sort
        of <em>black</em> poverty became a way to spin cutting public benefits
        for poor people as a supposedly anti-racist, anti-poverty strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, despite abundant evidence to the contrary, the charter-school
        industry and its advocates also make such claims, asserting that
        charters offer unique opportunities for poor African-American children.
        On those grounds, for example, the <em>Washington Post</em>
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/theres-nothing-progressive-about-strangling-charter-schools/2019/05/27/acb80baa-7bfb-11e9-a5b3-34f3edf1351e_story.html"
          >recently attacked</a
        >
        the Bernie Sanders campaign’s Thurgood Marshall Plan for Public
        Education, which, among other features, supports the NAACP’s call for a
        “moratorium on public funds for charter school expansion until a
        national audit has been conducted to determine the impact of charter
        growth in each state.” In a May 27 masthead editorial, the
        <em>Post</em> described charterization as a civil-rights issue, claiming
        that charter schools can remedy the “most enduring—and
        unforgivable—civil rights offense in our country today [which] is the
        consigning of so many poor, often minority children to failing schools.”
        To justify that claim, the editorial cites research indicating that
        black students in charter schools “gained an additional 59 days of
        learning in math and 44 days in reading per year compared with
        traditional school counterparts.”
      </p>
      <p>
        But that says nothing about how charter schools actually perform or what
        their impacts are on students, communities, and public-school systems.
        Here are some facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 2008 analysis of 47 studies conducted from 1999 to that year found
        that “on the whole, charters perform similarly to traditional public
        schools.” A 2009 16-state
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://credo.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj6481/f/multiple_choice_executive_summary.pdf"
          >study</a
        >
        found that only 17 percent of charters outperformed traditional schools
        in math, while 46 percent showed no significant difference, and 37
        percent actually <em>underperformed</em> public schools. A 2013
        follow-up 27-state
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"

        found improved results for charters, but that study has been

          >criticized</a
        >
        on technical and substantive grounds. And that is despite the fact that
        charter schools can “<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/TCR-Dirty-Dozen"

        >” enrollments in ways that traditional public schools cannot—for
        example, by imposing restrictive admission criteria, steering away less
        desirable students, and pushing out poorly performing ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unsurprisingly, therefore, charter schools are more racially segregated
        than their traditional public-school counterparts. An AP
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.apnews.com/e9c25534dfd44851a5e56bd57454b4f5"
          >analysis</a
        >
        of charter schools nationally found that “while 4 percent of traditional
        public schools are 99 percent minority, the figure is 17 percent for
        charters. In cities, where most charters are located, 25 percent of
        charters are over 99 percent nonwhite, compared to 10 percent for
        traditional schools.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, national research has
        <a

          href="https://www.laprogressive.com/charters-suspend-black-students/"

        that nonwhite and disabled students are disciplined, including with
        out-of-school suspension, at significantly higher rates than their
        counterparts in traditional public schools. Between 2002 and 2017, at
        least

        of new charter schools in California both opened in places with no need
        for additional classroom space <em>and</em> failed to provide an
        education superior to that in neighboring public schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        As is a common occurrence in the privatization of public functions, lack
        of effective public oversight has provided the charter-school industry
        great opportunities for fraud and corruption. A 2019 national
        <a

        by the Network for Public Education concluded among its findings that
        “hundreds of millions of [federal] taxpayer dollars” have been awarded
        to charter schools that never opened or opened and then shut down. Only
        a few months before the <em>Washington Post</em> editorial attacking
        Senator Sanders’s support for the NAACP’s call for a moratorium on
        charters, the newspaper published an investigative
        <a

      <p>
        Parents and students lose out in other ways as well from the
        charter-school boondoggle. Despite charter advocates’ claims that public
        funds devoted to charter schools do not harm public systems, the
        evidence tells a different story. A 2018
        <a

        of three California school districts found that each has suffered
        serious net fiscal shortfalls as a result of unconstrained charter
        expansion. In 2016–17 the shortfall for the Oakland Unified School
        District was $57.3 million—nearly the exact amount of the district’s
        expenditure on charters; for the San Diego Unified School District the
        shortfall was $65.9 million, and for Santa Clara County’s East Side
        Union High School District it was $19.3 million. Reports from

        also indicate that charter expansion has created significant budgetary
        problems for public-school districts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The charter industry is about profiting off education. In addition to
        the officially for-profit companies involved, even many charter
        nonprofits are structured in ways that enable people and businesses to
        make money off them. Charter operators and affiliated entities

        >
        to obtain and privately own valuable urban real estate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, administrative overhead for charter schools is often
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://nepc.colorado.edu/publication/charter-revenue"
          >more than twice</a
        >
        that of district schools, and charter executive salaries far exceed
        those of district administrators. A 2017
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://thelensnola.org/2017/01/17/study-says-new-orleans-schools-spend-more-on-administration-and-less-on-teaching-after-charter-transformation/"
          >report</a
        >
        found that in post-Katrina New Orleans, long touted as the Shangri-la of
        charterization, administrative spending per pupil had increased by 66
        percent, while instructional spending had declined by 10 percent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bad as the out-and-out fraudsters and get-rich-quick schemers are, the
        most dangerous and destructive elements in the charter-school industry
        are the billionaire “philanthropists” like Bill Gates, Walmart’s Walton
        family, and Eli Broad, the hedge-fund operators, corporate chains, and
        their minions in think tanks and on op-ed pages, who, out of ideological
        and commercial motives, have for some time been plotting the
        privatization of public schools and the destruction of public education
        as anything more than an underfunded holding pen for the least
        profitable students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joanne Barkan’s powerful essay, “Death by a Thousand Cuts: The Story of
        Privatizing Public Education,” made available by Valerie Strauss
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/05/30/what-and-who-is-fueling-the-movement-to-privatize-public-education-and-why-you-should-care/"
          >at the <em>Washington Post</em></a
        >, makes clear that the charter-school industry has always been intent
        on destruction of public education and its replacement by a private,
        market-driven system, ideally with profits guaranteed through public
        expenditures. That agenda requires undermining public accountability and
        democratic oversight, a commitment shared by the freelance billionaire
        “reformers” whose toxic blend of arrogance and avarice emboldens them to
        contend that, despite utter lack of expertise, they know better than
        teachers and education professionals, or even parents, what students
        need. Thus the charterizers’ arsenal depends on eliminating elected
        school boards and breaking teachers unions, which they stigmatize as
        protectors of greedy, lazy, backward-looking and incompetent
        time-servers and enemies of students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, teachers’ unions are the charter industry’s
        <em>bête noire</em> for a more old-school reason as well: there is no
        place for them in the business model. Charter-school teachers are paid
        less than teachers at traditional public schools, are less experienced,
        less likely to be certified, less satisfied with their jobs, have higher
        rates of turnover, and most important, are much more likely to be
        at-will employees who can be dismissed without cause. The charter-school
        industry has been able to impose these clearly less desirable working
        conditions on teachers partly through taking advantage of young,
        idealistic people funneled from outfits like Teach for America. And the
        long campaign stigmatizing public-school teachers, as well as other
        public workers, and their unions as the equivalent of lazy welfare
        queens has enabled propagation of a narrative projecting the image of
        fresh-faced, energetic young elite-college graduates as more effective
        and desirable than experienced teachers. Beyond that, “<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.thenation.com/article/what-happens-when-your-teacher-robot/"
          >reform</a
        >” often relies on eliminating teachers altogether in favor of
        “technology” in the form of replacement of actual teachers of any sort
        by online instruction, which is the “fastest-growing sector of the
        for-profit charter industry” even though “most studies show these
        schools have also produced the worst educational outcomes.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Simply put, charter advocates’ sanctimonious bluster about
        charterization as a civil-rights issue is deeply disingenuous, and the
        attacks on Bernie Sanders as racist for joining the NAACP in opposing it
        are repugnant. What education scholar Huriya Jabbar
        <a
          target="_blank"

          >describes</a
        >
        as the “uberization” of the teaching profession harms students and
        disproportionately nonwhite and poor ones, to be sure. In de-skilling
        teachers and reducing their working conditions and standard of living,
        it also is an attack on the African-American middle class, of which
        teachers have been a key element for more than a generation, especially
        in urban areas. In New Orleans, for example, in the nine years after
        Katrina the percentage of African-American teachers fell
        <a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://educationresearchalliancenola.org/files/publications/ERA1506-Policy-Brief-Teacher-Workforce-Cover.pdf"

          >similar</a
        >
        but less dramatic reductions in the representation of black and Hispanic
        teachers under neoliberal education reform. We are hard pressed to
        believe that eliminating or debasing black adults’ jobs can enhance
        black children’s educational experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The charter-school industry may be on the ropes, the victim of its own
        successes, which have exposed the reactionary, inegalitarian realities
        that often lie beneath the bogus promises. That no doubt is what leads
        its mouthpieces, including what Diane Ravitch aptly
        <a

        as its many “Astro-Turf Disrupters,” to reach for the preposterous claim
        that destruction of public schools is a civil-rights objective. Amy
        Wilkins
        <a
          target="_blank"

        Sanders’s Thurgood Marshall Plan as “galling” and asserts that “What
        <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em> did was say that
        government can’t tell black parents which schools they can and can’t
        send their kids to. What Senator Sanders is saying with his attempt to
        limit charter schools is telling black parents, who overwhelmingly
        support charters, that they can’t send their kids to charters any more.”
        In the first place, black and Hispanic support expressed for charter
        schools is not so great as Wilkins suggests, and drops substantially
        when respondents understand that funding for charters comes at the
        expense of traditional public schools.
