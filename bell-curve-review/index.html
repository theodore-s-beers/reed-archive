        Charles Murray first slithered into American public life a decade ago,
        when he published
        <em>Losing Ground: American Social Policy, &#x2028;1950&#x2013;1980</em
        >, in which he argued that the cause of poverty among black Americans is
        the very effort to alleviate poverty through social provision. He
        proposed, appropriately for a book bearing a 1984 publication date, that
        the poor would be best helped by the elimination of all social support;
        a regime of tough love would wean them from debilitating dependency, on
        pain of extermination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Murray has returned to the public stage now with publication of
        <em>The Bell Curve</em>, the product of a diabolical collaboration with
        Richard Herrnstein, the late Harvard psychologist known outside the
        academy for a more than twenty-year crusade to justify inequality by
        attributing it to innate, and therefore supposedly ineradicable,
        differences in intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Herrnstein and Murray contend that the key to explaining all inequality
        and all social problems in the United States is stratification by a
        unitary entity called intelligence, or &#x201C;cognitive
        ability&#x201D;&#x2014;as measured in IQ. Beneath the mind-numbing
        barrage of numbers, what really drives this book, and reflects the
        diabolism of the Murray/Herrnstein combination, is its claim to
        demonstrate black intellectual inferiority. They use IQ to support a
        &#x201C;twofer&#x201D;: opposition to affirmative action, which
        overplaces incompetent blacks, and the contention that black poverty
        derives from the existence of an innately inferior black underclass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their concern to insulate themselves from the appearance of
        racism, Herrnstein and Murray display a perspective worthy of an Alabama
        filling station. <em>The Bell Curve</em> is embedded in the intellectual
        apparatus of the crypto-fascist right. The central authorities on whom
        Herrnstein and Murray rely for their claims about IQ, race and heredity
        are nearly all associated with the Pioneer Fund, an ultrarightist
        foundation that was formed in the 1930s to advance eugenicist agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am convinced that having to do what I&#x2019;ve done in this review
        besmirches my dignity. It&#x2019;s a statement about the right&#x2019;s
        momentum that <em>The Bell Curve</em> makes such a splash that the
        <em>Nation</em> has to devote so much space to arming our troops against
        it. Mainstream racial discourse is dishonest and polluted enough to take
        the book seriously. Jason DeParle, in his
        <em>New York Times Magazine</em> puff piece, can&#x2019;t decide whether
        the Charles Murray who burned a cross in his youth, and who proposes a
        separate but equal world in which &#x201C;each clan will add up its
        accomplishments using its own weighting system&#xA0;&#x2026; and, most
        importantly, will not be concerned about comparing its accomplishments
        line-by-line with those of any other clan,&#x201D; is a racist.
        <em>New Republic</em> editor Andrew Sullivan opines that &#x201C;the
        notion that there might be resilient ethnic differences in intelligence
        is not&#xA0;&#x2026; an inherently racist belief.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        Murray has always been the same intellectual brownshirt. He has neither
        changed over the past decade nor done anything else that might redeem
        his reputation as a scholar. And it doesn&#x2019;t matter whether he is
        a committed ideologue or an amoral opportunist. Nazis came in both
        varieties&#x2014;think of Alfred Rosenberg and Paul de Man&#x2014;and in
        real life the lines separating the two are seldom clear.
