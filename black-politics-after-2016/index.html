    <section id="body-text">
      <p>
        Many pundits and scholars have remarked on how the 2016 election
        reflected the significance of race in American politics. One strain of
        commentary to that effect contends that Trump&#x2019;s election revealed
        a deep commitment to racism among white voters, especially working-class
        white voters, who are fundamentally alienated from a Democratic
        liberalism identified with nonwhites, feminists, LGBTQ people, and
        liberal technocratic elites.
      </p>
      <p>
        From that perspective, the strategic moral of the Trump victory is that,
        as MSNBC Clintonoid Joy-Ann Reid put it in an August 29, 2017
        <em>Daily Show</em> interview, the Democrats must recognize that they
        are the party of &#x201C;black and brown people, of gay people, of
        marginalized people&#x201D; and should stop longing &#x201C;to be the
        party of the sort of Pabst Blue Ribbon voter, the kind of Coors Lite
        drinking voter&#xA0;&#x2026; the sort of Archie Bunker voters&#x201D;
        because the latter are committed Republicans. Reid imagines that, even
        though most Americans&#x2019; incomes have remained flat or declined and
        their lives have become more precarious over the period, the Democrats
        have been trying to appeal to those voters&#x2019; economic interests
        for forty years only to be rebuffed consistently because the latter care
        more about their &#x201C;values&#x201D; than their economic interests,
        and &#x201C;the Republican party represents their values.&#x201D; She
        also indicated, albeit indirectly, the other component of what she sees
        as the core Democratic base: &#x201C;Democrats vote against their
        economic interests. If you live in New York and you make, you know, New
        York salary, you&#x2019;re voting against your economic interests
        whenever you vote for Democrats; they raise your taxes. You vote your
        values.&#x201D; Clearly, she does not have in mind the New York salaries
        of teachers, transit workers, butchers, nurses, home health care aides,
        or librarians.
      </p>
      <p>
        To punctuate her point about the folly of pursuing the voters she
        caricatures with imputed consumer preferences, Harvard grad Reid,
        alluding to the Bernie Sanders campaign&#x2019;s call for free public
        higher education, asserted that the Democrats are &#x201C;not going to
        convince them by saying &#x2018;we&#x2019;ll give you free
        college,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; and, brushing off Trevor Noah&#x2019;s
        query about the option of pursuing universal social policies that would
        benefit everyone, she made clear what conflict in &#x201C;values&#x201D;
        she considers paramount. She reduced the notion of universal social wage
        policy essentially to its opposite&#x2014;Bill Clinton&#x2019;s magical
        claim that economic growth on whatever terms is good for all, which she
        then dismissed as an erroneous conviction that &#x201C;a rising tide
        will bring all the races together.&#x201D; In her view, that conviction
        was wishful thinking because the central fault line in national politics
        concerns what she called &#x201C;the racial discussion,&#x201D; and she
        contended that &#x201C;what black people generally want is a reckoning;
        they want to acknowledge the past and to reckon with it&#x201D; but that
        &#x201C;the country&#x201D; instead &#x201C;wants a pass&#x201D; from
        that reckoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another view proceeds from similar characterization of the crucial fault
        line but draws the lesson that Democrats should abandon the
        &#x201C;culture war&#x201D; framework and appeal to those scorned
        culturally conservative working-class whites who in earlier times were
        the party&#x2019;s core electoral base. Clinton flack Mark Penn and
        consummate Wall Street Democrat Andrew Stein exemplified this argument
        in &#x201C;<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/opinion/center-democrats-identity-politics.html"
          >Back to the Center, Democrats</a
        >&#x201D; (<em>New York Times</em>, July 6, 2017). They argue,
        &#x201C;Central to the Democrats&#x2019; diminishment has been their
        loss of support among working-class voters, who feel abandoned by the
        party&#x2019;s shift away from moderate positions on trade and
        immigration, from backing police and tough anti-crime measures, from
        trying to restore manufacturing jobs.&#x201D; They assert that those
        voters moreover &#x201C;see themselves as being penalized for
        maintaining the basic values of hard work, religion, and family.&#x201D;
        Instead, Penn and Stein contend, the disaffected &#x201C;saw the party
        being mired too often in political correctness, transgender bathroom
        issues, and offering more help to undocumented immigrants than to the
        heartland.&#x201D; Like Reid, they argue that the key division in the
        electorate is over values, but they recommend that the Democrats need to
        bridge that divide by &#x201C;embracing free speech on campuses and
        respect for Catholics and people of other faiths who feel marginalized
        within the party&#x201D;&#x2014;that is, tilting right on so called
        social issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Significantly, Reid and Penn and Stein share a conviction that, as the
        latter put it, &#x201C;Big government handouts won&#x2019;t win
        working-class voters back&#x201D; and that Democrats should
        &#x201C;reject socialist ideas&#x201D; and the &#x201C;siren calls of
        the left.&#x201D; They also share a view of the working class as by
        definition white and conservative. Where Reid calls for doubling down on
        cultivating an electoral coalition centered on nonwhites, gay people,
        <em>etc</em>. in the name of appealing to the marginalized, Penn and
        Stein advocate moving away from that coalition&#x2014;also in the name
        of appealing to the marginalized. Although Penn and Stein urge
        commitment to &#x201C;greater protection for American workers,&#x201D;
        in the same breath they call for &#x201C;return to fiscal
        responsibility&#x201D; and &#x201C;reach[ing] across the aisle to show
        they understand that voters like bipartisanship.&#x201D; They gesture
        toward concern for shoring up working-class living standards, but their
        fundamental proposal is for the party to move to the right, or in their
        terms, the &#x201C;center.&#x201D; They acknowledge no contradiction
        between those objectives because all their references to working
        people&#x2019;s material concerns are platitudes consistent with their
        nostalgic faith in the early Clintonite/Democratic Leadership Council
        (DLC) formula of combining stimulation of financial sector-driven
        economic growth and ultimately symbolic racialized appeals&#x2014;to
        blacks and Latinos mainly in the form of appointments and honorific
        displays and to (presumptively conservative) whites as
        &#x201C;supporting a balanced budget, welfare reform, a crime bill that
        called for providing 100,000 new police officers, and a step-by-step
        approach to broadening health care&#x201D;&#x2014;and depending on
        unions for campaign support on the sole ground that &#x201C;the other
        guy is worse.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        The tendencies that Reid and Penn and Stein reflect vie to define
        strategic response to the 2016 defeat
        <em>within the framework of Democratic neoliberalism</em>. They share a
        view that the terms of their debate should mark the boundaries of the
        politically thinkable for progressives. Both reject out of hand
        arguments that Trump&#x2019;s victory signals a need to consider a
        social-democratic agenda; both insist that redistributive social and
        economic policies are less meaningful to voters than cultural or racial
        group identities. Penn and Stein represent Democratic
        neoliberalism&#x2019;s right wing that calls for catering to the
        conservative, intolerant stances in the so-called culture war, but not
        so directly as Republicans, not least because the party remains
        dependent electorally on black, Latino, labor and socially liberal
        voters. That is the element of the party that interprets every victory
        or defeat as demonstrating the need to move to the steadily rightward
        trending &#x201C;center&#x201D; and constructs fantasy constituencies
        drawn from census data and opinion surveys&#x2014;soccer moms, national
        security moms, moderate Republicans&#x2014;to justify that
        interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
        That wing of the party&#x2019;s opposition to redistributive policies
        and its disingenuousness regarding race and reproductive rights in
        particular have long been well known for what they are. As early as 1991
        the late Julian Bond and I co-edited a special issue of the
        <em>Nation</em> dedicated to responses to that New
        Liberalism&#x2014;&#x201C;The Assault on Equality: Race, Rights and the
        New Orthodoxy,&#x201D; which was the basis of a subsequent book,
        <em
          >Without Justice for All: The New Liberalism and Our Retreat from
          Racial Equality</em
        >. Ours was by no means the only such challenge to the conservative turn
        spearheaded by the DLC. (It is worth recalling that both Bill Clinton
        and Al Gore were presidents of the DLC, which was formed in the wake of
        Walter Mondale&#x2019;s 1984 defeat explicitly to push the party to the
        right.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The 2016 campaign made clear, however, that the Democrats&#x2019;
        identitarian left wing also rejects proposals for a broadly solidaristic
        program focused on combating economic inequality. Especially telling in
        this regard were the attacks by random, self-anointed Black Lives Matter
        activists on Bernie Sanders for not declaring his opposition to
        &#x201C;systemic racism&#x201D; in a way that suited their tastes and
        former civil rights movement icon Rep.&#xA0;John Lewis&#x2019;s (D-GA)
        and other prominent black functionaries&#x2019; denunciations of
        Sanders&#x2019;s calls for greatly expanding social wage policy and
        shifting national priorities toward addressing the needs of working
        people as irresponsible, if not un-American.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps most telling of all was when and especially how Hillary Clinton
        blithely blew off Sanders&#x2019;s focus on economic inequality and
        corporate power. On the eve of the Nevada primary, she declared to a
        rally of her supporters &#x201C;Not everything is about an economic
        theory, right? If we broke up the big banks tomorrow&#x2014;and I will,
        if they deserve it, if they pose a systemic risk, I will&#x2014;would
        that end racism? Would that end sexism? Would that end discrimination
        against the LGBT community? Would that make people feel more welcoming
        to immigrants overnight? Would that solve our problem with voting
        rights, and Republicans who are trying to strip them away from people of
        color, the elderly, the young?&#x201D; (David Weigel, &#x201C;Clinton in
        Nevada: &#x2018;Not Everything Is about an Economic
        Theory,&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; <em>Washington Post</em>, February 13,
        2016).
      </p>
      <p>
        Her observation was technically correct but beside the point, a willful
        dodge. I quipped at the time that seriously regulating the financial
        sector would not eliminate sun spots or help Bahrain win the World Cup
        either, but doing so, especially in concert with social wage policies
        like those Sanders also proposed, could improve the lives and economic
        security of millions of working people and their families of all races,
        genders and sexual orientations. Clinton&#x2019;s objective was to
        deflect discussion of economic inequality at a moment when the society
        becomes more strikingly unequal almost by the day. Paul Krugman
        attempted to rationalize her dodge with an argument that what he calls
        &#x201C;horizontal inequality&#x201D;&#x2014;aggregate-level disparities
        between groups&#x2014;is actually more important than inequality in the
        society writ large (Krugman, &#x201C;<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/10/opinion/hillary-and-the-horizontals.html"
          >Hillary and the Horizontals</a
        >,&#x201D; <em>New York Times</em>, June 10, 2016). (There are many
        reasons, to be sure, that former Johnson and Nixon administration
        functionary, Harvard professor, U.S. Senator, and Olympic caliber
        blowhard Daniel Patrick Moynihan, would be burning in Hell right now if
        there were such a place. One that is not often noted is his insidious
        move in the infamous 1965 report for the Johnson administration&#x2019;s
        Labor Department,
        <em>The Negro Family: The Case for National Action</em>, to characterize
        the problem of inequality in groupist terms, the equivalent of
        Krugman&#x2019;s horizontal inequality, which underwrote treating it as
        a problem rooted in culture rather than political economy.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the election, antiracist commentators and internet activists in
        particular have become even more aggressive in red-baiting Sanders and a
        politics centered on economic redistribution, and to do so they rely on
        a new vector of race-baiting&#x2014;attacking advocacy of
        social-democratic politics as intrinsically racist or white supremacist.
        The move, as Reid implied in her response to Noah&#x2019;s query, links
        advocacy of economic redistribution to the rightist turn urged by Penn
        and Stein and others, thus casting argument for appeal to working-class
        concerns as <em>ipso facto</em> an apology for white racism.
        Clintonites&#x2019; fabrication of the &#x201C;Bernie bros&#x201D;
        bugbear is a cynical bourgeois (or &#x201C;lean-in&#x201D;) feminist
        version of that smear intended to paint advocacy of a redistributive
        politics as sexist.
      </p>
      <p>
        This political tendency has congealed around a perspective that renders
        &#x201C;working class&#x201D; as a white racial category and synonym for
        backwardness and bigotry and condemns working-class whites who voted for
        Trump as loathsome racists with whom political solidarity is
        indefensible. Antiracists and other identitarian Democrats reject
        suggestions that motives other than racism, sexism, homophobia,
        transphobia, or xenophobia may have been significant in generating the
        Trump vote. In this struggle for interpretation, which is also a
        struggle over strategic direction, antiracist identitarians and the
        Clintonite right-wing deny that many working people, including those
        whom Les Leopold (&#x201C;<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/02/10/how-win-back-obama-sanders-and-trump-voters"
          >How to Win Back Obama, Sanders, and Trump Voters</a
        >,&#x201D; <em>Common Dreams</em>, February 10, 2017) describes as
        Obama/Sanders/Trump voters&#x2014;who were not exclusively
        white&#x2014;may have good reasons to feel betrayed by both parties and
        that those reasons may have been a significant factor in their decisions
        to vote for Trump. In the antiracist line of argument, although having
        voted previously for Obama once or even twice cannot be taken as
        evidence that white voters were not racist, or motivated primarily by
        race, having voted for Trump is incontrovertible evidence that they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        The upshot of that view is to write off what, according to Larry
        Sabato&#x2019;s estimate (&#x201C;<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/just-how-many-obama-2012-trump-2016-voters-were-there/"
          >Just How Many Obama 2012&#xA0;&#x2013; Trump 2016 Voters Were
          There?</a
        >&#x201D; <em>Sabato&#x2019;s Crystal Ball</em>, June 1, 2017), may
        amount to between nearly seven million and more than nine million
        voters, many of whose support for Trump surely stemmed from concerns
        more complex than commitment to white supremacy. Some percentage of
        those people, and there is no way to know how many until we try to
        connect with them politically, voted for Trump at least partly for
        reasons similar to those for which they voted for Obama (see, for
        example, Leslie Lopez, &#x201C;&#x2009;<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://nonsite.org/editorial/i-believe-trump-like-i-believed-obama"
          >&#x2018;I Believe Trump Like I Believed Obama&#x2019;: A Case Study

        >,&#x201D; <em>nonsite</em>, November 28, 2016). Dismissing those
        voters, and, more to the point, dismissing appeals to broad economic and
        social wage concerns, leaves as the only political possibility for the
        left a version of the coalition Reid adduced as the Democrats&#x2019;
        proper base, including the key component she evoked but did not mention
        explicitly&#x2014;Wall Street and Silicon Valley money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another prominent former Clintonista, Douglas Schoen (&#x201C;<a
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/opinion/why-democrats-need-wall-street.html"
          >Why Democrats Need Wall Street</a
        >,&#x201D; <em>New York Times</em>, October 17, 2017), in arguing for
        <em>strengthening</em> Democrats&#x2019; ties to Wall Street, provides a
        window onto the character of that coalition. He attacks the left vision
        of &#x201C;wealth redistribution through higher taxes and Medicare for
        all, and demonizing Wall Street&#x201D; and dismisses calls for a
        $15/hr. minimum wage and increased banking regulation as
        &#x201C;ineffective, negative, and coercive.&#x201D; Like Penn, his
        former associate, and Stein, Schoen proposes the same tired DLC
        bromides&#x2014;more deregulation, business-friendly economic policies
        along with a sop that those policies &#x201C;must prioritize
        entrepreneurship, small business growth and the expansion of
        job-training and retraining programs&#x201D;&#x2014;that have
        contributed to intensifying upward redistribution and the backlash
        against it. He even touts Clinton&#x2019;s deregulation of the
        telecommunications industry and repeal of Glass-Steagall as great
        accomplishments to be built upon. It would be difficult to script an
        approach more at odds with the frustrations that both Sanders and Trump
        tapped into in 2016. I doubt, however, that Schoen is so much out of
        touch with that popular frustration as that he wants to squash its
        expression. His assertion that &#x201C;the party has left behind&#x201D;
        fealty to the financial sector and lurched leftward cannot be taken
        seriously as an empirical assessment. He wants to preempt any such shift
        and reassert the mantra that there is no alternative to a political
        agenda driven by Wall Street.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schoen&#x2019;s version of the DLC mantra also shows how commitment to
        diversity distinguishes Democratic from Republican neoliberalism. After
        scoring the left for its irresponsible and unpopular extremism, he
        cautions, &#x201C;For the 2020 election, some the party&#x2019;s
        strongest potential presidential candidates&#x2014;Senators Cory Booker,
        Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris as well as Deval Patrick, the
        former Massachusetts governor&#x2014;should not be dismissed simply
        because of their current or past ties to Wall Street.&#x201D; Harris and
        Booker emerged as possible contenders for the 2020 nomination far too
        soon after the last election, and it is certainly reasonable to suspect
        that, notwithstanding whatever else may appeal about either of them,
        their early prominence has to do in part with the fact that they are
        nonwhite <em>and</em> linked to the financial sector wing of the party.
        Early efforts to create a groundswell for them bring to mind similar
        efforts to invent John Kerry in 2004 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 as
        prohibitive favorites&#x2014;partly on the claim that they could best
        raise financial sector money&#x2014;and thereby foreclose policy debate
        in service to the imperative to close ranks around the supposedly
        eventual nominee. Patrick and Gillibrand have been on the national stage
        longer, and, as an African American and a woman, both with close Wall
        Street ties, they also fit the bill as representatives of identitarian
        neoliberalism, which it is worth recalling that Barack Obama embodied as
        Wall Street&#x2019;s preferred candidate in 2008. The absurd recent
        Oprah moment underscores this element&#x2019;s desperation to hit upon
        the winning identitarian neoliberal formula, or at least to make certain
        that the quest for that formula exhausts &#x201C;progressive&#x201D;
        political debate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The baseline premise linking Reid&#x2019;s, Penn and Stein&#x2019;s, and
        Schoen&#x2019;s stances is out of hand rejection of calls for broadly
        redistributive policy or frontal challenges to economic inequality. It
        is not news that Penn, Stein, and Schoen embrace that view. As debates
        proceed over ways forward for progressives, it has become clear that the
        left-identitarian stance Reid exemplifies is no less committed to the
        market-driven economic and social policy framework. Exposing that
        continuity is an unanticipated outcome of 2016, and progressives would
        be wise to take it into account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Largely because of the challenge posed by the alternative political
        vision that Sanders advanced and the subsequent struggle over how to
        interpret the meanings of Trump&#x2019;s victory, the 2016 election and
        its aftermath have thrown into relief the extent to which antiracism,
        and other formulations of politics based on ascriptive identities, are
        not simply alternatives to a (working) class politics, as
        Clinton&#x2019;s cheesy put-down during the campaign implied. What is
        typically called identity politics reflects the perspective of a
        different class, the professional and managerial strata who are
        relatively insulated from the negative impacts of the four decades long
        regime of regressive redistribution and better positioned to take
        advantage of the opportunity structures it opens. That perspective
        suggests a reason many high-profile antiracists have become so vehement
        in their opposition to a politics centered on downward economic
        redistribution. As Kenneth Warren <em>et al</em>. put it in &#x201C;<a

        <p>
          Antiracists&#xA0;&#x2026; remain attuned to a vision of justice
          defined by ensuring equal access to hierarchically distributed social
          goods such as family wealth (and redressing historical impediments to
          the accumulation of wealth rooted in discrimination). Indeed in making
          frequent recourse to the adjective &#x201C;narrow&#x201D; in
          chastising a politics that roots inequality in economic exploitation,
          antiracists and identitarians have positioned the idea of racial
          justice as a critique of, rather than an expected consequence of,
          socialism. It is largely for this reason that, as Walter Benn Michaels
          has noted&#xA0;&#x2026; &#x201C;the commitment to identity politics
          has been more an expression of&#xA0;&#x2026; enthusiasm for the free
          market than a form of resistance to it.&#x201D;
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reid and others reject efforts to reinvigorate a politics based on broad
        solidarities and egalitarian redistribution from a standpoint that
        accepts the deeper dynamics of market-driven inequality as natural. The
        antiracist objection is, in effect, that black concerns are limited to
        racial disparities&#x2014;blacks&#x2019; relatively unfavorable position
        in aggregate distribution of the society&#x2019;s good and bad outcomes
        among statistically defined groups, Krugman&#x2019;s &#x201C;horizontal
        inequalities.&#x201D; But, as the society becomes ever more starkly
        unequal across the board with respect to wealth, income and all that
        follows from those economic inequalities, insistence that disparities
        between groups are the true metric of social justice does more to
        justify the larger system of inequality than to challenge it. By that
        standard, as Walter Benn Michaels and I have often argued, the society
        would be just if one percent of the population controlled ninety percent
        of the resources so long as that one percent were itself twelve percent
        black, seventeen percent Hispanic, fifty percent female, and so on.
        Eliminating disparities without addressing the deeper structures that
        generate, reproduce, and intensify economic inequality in general would
        still leave large majorities of blacks, Hispanics, women, LGBTQ people,
        <em>etc</em>. poorly off and economically insecure. And this does not
        apply only to wealth disparities; as my colleague Marie Gottschalk
        points out in
        <em>Caught: The Prison State and the Lockdown of American Politics</em>,
        eliminating racial disparities in incarceration would still leave us
        with the largest imprisoned population in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The limitations of contemporary antiracist politics have not been much
        noticed or commented upon, in large measure because we are accustomed to
        think about the nexus of race and politics, and black politics in
        particular, in terms rooted in a notion of &#x201C;race
        relations,&#x201D; which presumes that blacks and whites&#x2014;or
        &#x201C;black America&#x201D; and &#x201C;white
        America&#x201D;&#x2014;are basic, indivisible units of political
        interest. Historian Michael Rudolph West, in
        <em
          >The Education of Booker T. Washington: American Democracy and the
          Idea of Race Relations</em
        >
        (Columbia University Press, 2006), points up the anti-democratic
        premises and corrosive effects of the race relations idea as it took
        shape at the end of the nineteenth century in the context of massive
        disfranchisement of black voters and imposition of the segregationist
        regime that effectively denied blacks&#x2019; citizenship rights. The
        race relations framework, West argues, appealed to white elites because
        it sidestepped the troublesome fact of blacks&#x2019; constitutional
        claims to full and equal citizenship by proposing a focus on the
        evanescent issue of how the &#x201C;races&#x201D; relate as an
        alternative to matters like denial of rights and equal protection under
        the law. He notes that &#x201C;interests and aspirations of politicians
        and ministers, workers and businessmen, parents and teachers would no
        longer be expressed by way of the normal, if potentially messy,
        institutional channels through which Americans settled their conflicts
        and competition. Instead they would be mediated through the good offices
        of &#x2018;Negro leaders&#x2019; ever mindful of where their mandate
        comes from and the requirement placed on them as a first principle
        &#x2018;to cement the friendship of the two
        races&#x2019;&#x2009;&#x201D; (56&#x2013;7), on terms, of course, set by
        the white elites.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most of the twentieth century, throughout the period when legally
        enforced racial subordination and officially countenanced discrimination
        were injustices that, in principle if not always in practice, confronted
        the race universally, it was reasonable to assume that black Americans
        were united across the board in opposition to enforced racial inequality
        and in support of equal opportunity. That is, the basis for presuming a
        unitary black agenda rested on concrete historical facts of life rather
        than racialist mysticism. That was the reality expressed in
        W.&#xA0;E.&#xA0;B. Du Bois&#x2019;s pithy 1940 apothegm, in response to
        an apocryphal interlocutor&#x2019;s quest for a definition of the Negro,
        &#x201C;the black man is a person who must ride Jim Crow in
        Georgia.&#x201D; Yet, black Americans&#x2019; politics even then was
        more complex than shared opposition to specifically racial injustice. A
        year before Du Bois&#x2019;s observation, political scientist Ralph
        Bunche discussed the limits of a politics based on racial unity. He
        criticized the National Negro Congress, a militant black united front
        organization, because its effectiveness was undercut by its
        &#x201C;assumption that the common denominator of race is enough to weld
        together, in thought and action, such diverse segments of the Negro
        society as preachers and labor organizers, lodge officials and black
        workers, Negro businessmen, Negro radicals, professional politicians,
        professional men, domestic servants, butchers, bakers, and candlestick
        makers.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        As Bunche&#x2019;s criticism suggests, black political differentiation
        was significant even in the midst of the Jim Crow era. Moreover, race
        never exhausted the universe of black Americans&#x2019; political
        concerns. From Emancipation through the 1960s, black political
        engagement was not restricted exclusively to racial issues. In the late
        1870s blacks in Virginia aligned with white workers and small farmers in
        the proto-populist Readjuster Party that elected a governor and a U.S.
        Senator. In the 1880s, membership in the radical Knights of Labor
        included roughly 60,000 blacks. In the 1890s, the Colored Farmers
        Alliance, black expression of the Populist insurgency, had 1,250,000
        members, and in 1894 an interracial Populist-Republican Fusion alliance
        won statewide power in North Carolina as well as in several
        municipalities in the state and was re-elected by a larger margin in
        1896. In New Orleans in 1892 black workers participated with whites in a
        general strike that withstood employers&#x2019; and white supremacist
        politicians&#x2019; efforts to break their solidarity through racist
        agitation. In the 1930s and 1940s and beyond, black activists generally
        presumed that unionization and expanded social wage policies were
        necessary conditions for continued black advancement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black political debate and action through the early 1960s focused on
        concrete issues&#x2014;employment, housing, wages, unionization,
        discrimination in specific venues and domains&#x2014;rather than an
        abstract &#x201C;racism.&#x201D; It was only in the late 1960s and
        1970s, after the legislative victories that defeated southern apartheid
        and restored black Americans&#x2019; full citizenship rights, that
        &#x201C;racism&#x201D; was advanced as the default explanation for
        inequalities that appear as racial disparities. That view emerged from
        Black Power politics and its commitment to a race-first communitarian
        ideology that posited the standpoint of an idealized &#x201C;black
        community&#x201D; as the standard for political judgment, which Bayard
        Rustin predicted at the time would ensue only in creation of a
        &#x201C;new black establishment.&#x201D; It was ratified as a
        commonsense piety of racial liberalism by the
        <em>Report of the Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders</em
        >&#x2014;popularly known as the Kerner Commission, after its chair,
        Illinois Governor Otto Kerner&#x2014;which asserted that &#x201C;white
        racism&#x201D; was the ultimate source of the manifold inequalities the
        <em>Report</em> catalogued as well as the pattern of civil disturbances
        the commission had been empaneled to investigate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reduction of black politics to a timeless struggle against abstractions
        like racism and white supremacy or for others like freedom and
        liberation obscures the extent to which black Americans&#x2019;
        political activity has evolved and been shaped within broader American
        political currents. That view, which oscillates between heroic and
        tragic, overlooks the fact that the mundane context out of which racism
        became a default explanation, or alternative to explanation, for
        inequality, was a national debate over how to guide anti-poverty policy
        and the struggle for fair employment practices in the early 1960s.
        Left-of-center public attention to poverty and persistent unemployment
        at the beginning of the 1960s divided into two camps. One, represented
        most visibly by figures like Secretary of Labor W. Willard Wirtz,
        Senators Joseph Clark (D-PA) and Hubert H. Humphrey (D-MN), United Auto
        Workers President Walter Reuther, and black labor and civil rights
        leader A. Philip Randolph, argued that both phenomena stemmed from
        structural inadequacies in the postwar economy, largely the consequence
        of technological reorganization, especially in manufacturing. From that
        perspective, effectively addressing those conditions would require
        direct and large scale federal intervention in labor markets, including
        substantial investment in public works employment and skills-based,
        targeted job-training.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other camp saw poverty and persistent unemployment as residual
        problems resulting from deficiencies of values, attitudes, and human
        capital (a notion then only recently popularized) in individuals and
        groups that hindered them from participating fully in a dynamic labor
        market rather than from inadequacies in overall economic performance. In
        that view, addressing poverty and persistent unemployment did not
        require major intervention in labor markets. A large tax cut intended to
        stimulate aggregate demand would eliminate unacceptably high rates of
        unemployment, and anti-poverty policy would center on fixing the
        deficiencies within residual populations. Job training would focus on
        teaching &#x201C;job readiness&#x201D;&#x2014;attitudes and
        values&#x2014;more than specific skills. Liberals connected to the Ford
        Foundation and the Kennedy and Johnson administrations saw chronic
        poverty as bound up with inadequate senses of individual and group
        efficacy rather than economic performance. That interpretation supported
        a policy response directed to enhancing the sense of efficacy among
        impoverished individuals and communities, partly through mobilization
        for civic action. The War on Poverty&#x2019;s Community Action program
        gave that approach a militant or populist patina through its commitment
        to &#x201C;grassroots&#x201D; mobilization of poor people on their own
        behalf. In addition, Community Action Agencies and Model Cities projects
        facilitated insurgent black and Latino political mobilization in cities
        around the country, which reinforced a general sense of their
        radicalism. At the same time, however, those programs reinforced
        liberals&#x2019; tendencies to separate race from class and inequality
        from political economy and to substitute participation or representation
        for redistribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both camps assumed that black economic inequality stemmed significantly
        from current and past discrimination. A consequential difference between
        them, though, was that those who emphasized the need for robust
        employment policies contended that much black unemployment resulted from
        structural economic factors that were beyond the reach of anti-
        discrimination efforts. To that extent, improving black
        Americans&#x2019; circumstances would require broader social-democratic
        intervention in the political economy, including significantly expanded
        social wage policy. As Randolph observed at the 1963 March on
        Washington, &#x201C;Yes, we want a Fair Employment Practices Act, but
        what good will it do if profit-geared automation destroys the jobs of
        millions of workers, black and white? We want integrated public schools,
        but that means we also want federal aid to education&#x2014;all forms of
        education.&#x201D; The other camp, in line with then Assistant Secretary
        of Labor Moynihan&#x2019;s <em>Negro Family</em> jeremiad, construed
        black unemployment and poverty as deriving from an ambiguous confluence
        of current discrimination and cultural pathologies produced by
        historical racism. For a variety of reasons having to do with both large
        politics and small, the latter vision won.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the late historian Judith Stein summarized the outcome in her
        important account of the period,
        <em
          >Running Steel, Running America: Race, Economic Policy, and the
          Decline of Liberalism</em
        >:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The causes of both poverty and black unemployment were separated from
          the workings of the economy. The War on Poverty redirected both its
          own and the Labor Department&#x2019;s manpower programs from the
          skilled to the unskilled, from adults to young people, and from whites
          to blacks. Discussions of unemployment, underemployment, and low wages
          were replaced by discourses on inadequate motivation, education, and
          culture, factors limiting a person&#x2019;s ability to take advantage
          of opportunity.
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Defeat of Democratic liberalism&#x2019;s social-democratic tendency was
        underscored by the failed effort to organize around
        <em>A &#x201C;Freedom Budget&#x201D; for All Americans</em>, issued in
        1966 by Randolph and the AFL-CIO&#x2019;s new A. Philip Randolph
        Institute. The Budget&#x2019;s objective was to reduce unemployment to
        less than three percent by 1968 and poverty to no more than one or two
        percent by 1975. Programmatically, it called for increasing the federal
        minimum wage to a level that would lift the working poor out of poverty;
        providing guaranteed income above the poverty level for those unable to
        work; guaranteeing access to affordable, good-quality housing for all;
        access to proper medical care for all, as well as educational
        opportunity for all, &#x201C;up to the limits of their abilities and
        ambitions, at costs within their means;&#x201D; expansion of funding for
        the public sector to repair and improve physical infrastructure;
        maintenance of adequate environmental standards; and expansion of public
        transportation. By then, however, the window for possible
        social-democratic intervention had closed, partly because substantial
        new social spending had been precluded first by the terms on which the
        Johnson administration implemented the tax-cut Kennedy Keynesians had
        proposed to boost aggregate demand and then by the requirements of
        funding the Vietnam war. (The Freedom Budget argued, to no avail, that
        it was possible to fund both its recommendations and the war.) Stalwarts
        like Sen.&#xA0;Clark, who only a few years earlier had called for a
        policy of aggressive labor market intervention, in 1967 dismissed the
        <em>Freedom Budget</em> as a nonstarter: &#x201C;I think in the best of
        all possible worlds, it would be a wonderful thing, but as a matter of
        pragmatic politics, it seems to me utterly unrealistic.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        Resolution of the debates over persistent unemployment and poverty and
        the fate of the Freedom Budget marked a definitive turn away from
        social-democratic intervention in manpower and social policy. Not only
        did the Keynesian tax cut, and then Vietnam, preempt new social
        spending. Passage of a watered-down version of the Humphrey-Hawkins Full
        Employment and Balanced Growth Act in 1978 affirmed the defeat; the
        Carter administration palliated black elites with appointments and then
        imposed austerity on working people of whatever race. Stagflation and
        economic instability in the mid-1970s justified retrenchment that only
        deepened and became hegemonic over the Carter-Reagan-Bush-Clinton years
        and culminated in New Democrat Bill Clinton&#x2019;s declaration in his
        1996 State of the Union address that &#x201C;The era of big government
        is over.&#x201D; Having abjured political-economic critique, many
        left-liberals came to accept the reigning assumptions of neoclassical
        economics as the equivalent of unalterable nature and to treat
        persisting inequalities, as Stein indicates, as deriving fundamentally
        from deficiencies of the poor and economically marginal populations
        themselves and/or from ethereal forces like racism or sexism.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that the major civil rights victories were consolidated on
        terms that reflected defeat of the social-democratic tendency in the
        liberal-left had significant consequences for black politics and for the
        role of race and interest-group dynamics that would take shape over the
        next half century. In the early 1960s civil rights advocates understood
        that manifest racial inequality, especially economic inequality, often
        did not result from direct discrimination. Randolph and Rustin were
        perhaps most visible but not alone in recognizing that complexity. Most
        of the prominent civil rights leadership preferred an approach that tied
        fair employment policy to pursuit of a full employment agenda, but Title
        VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act focused on discrimination to the
        exclusion of structural economic forces, and the bill&#x2019;s passage
        on those terms altered opportunity structures in a way that at least
        softened that preference for many. &#x201C;Like the analysis of
        poverty,&#x201D; Stein observes, &#x201C;the causes of black
        unemployment were first joined to the economy, in 1963, and then
        divorced from it in the legislation of 1964.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 1963 Senate Hearings on S. 1937, which would have incorporated
        Fair Employment Practices legislation into a more robust manpower bill,
        Senator Humphrey and Labor Secretary Wirtz emphasized that
        &#x201C;institutional&#x201D; processes that did not involve intentional
        discrimination accounted for much of black disadvantage in the labor
        market. Within five years &#x201C;institutional racism,&#x201D;
        popularized by Stokely Carmichael and Charles V. Hamilton&#x2019;s
        <em>Black Power: The Politics of Liberation</em>, the Kerner Report and
        other widely read texts, had become a conventional formulation intended
        to fit those ostensibly nonracial institutional factors into an
        antiracist ideological and policy discourse. The formulation was partly
        a pragmatic adaptation to a legal framework that recognized invidious
        racial treatment, but not unequal outcomes produced by more diffuse
        market forces or institutional practices, as a basis for remedial
        action.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a concept, however, institutional racism also fit within a new black
        politics in the 1970s. With the rise of a stratum of black public
        officials and functionaries enabled by the 1965 Voting Rights Act,
        changing urban racial demography, and expanded opportunity structures,
        black politics largely settled, as political scientist Cedric Johnson
        has argued, into a routine racial interest-group affair, an ethnic
        politics, that accommodated to the national retreat from redistributive
        social wage policy by defining a specifically racial agenda limited to
        challenging disparities and demanding ultimately symbolic appointments
        and honorific recognition. Consistent with West&#x2019;s observation
        regarding the race relations idea, this black ethnic politics requires
        abstracting away from the many materially and personally meaningful
        identities that black people share with others to condense around race
        as a singular concern. It requires, that is, that black people disappear
        from and often be contrasted to broader categories of teachers,
        students, homeowners, landlords, renters, clerks, parents, stamp
        collectors, steelworkers, public employees, electricians, cable
        technicians, carpenters, people concerned with health care, climate
        change, foreign policy, <em>etc</em>. Blacks&#x2019; disappearance as
        autonomous citizens has been facilitated by proliferation over the 1980s
        and 1990s of the imagery of a benighted, pathological black
        &#x201C;urban underclass&#x201D; that exists only as an object of
        policy, as a problem population to be administered, not the subjects of
        political decision-making. Illustrative of how pervasive that just-so
        underclass story has become, candidate Barack Obama only fully
        established his racial <em>bona fides</em> in 2008 with
        &#x201C;tough-love&#x201D; speeches directed against a stereotypically
        pathological black underclass that he gave before black congregations
        and the NAACP convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially in a context in which downwardly redistributive social and
        economic policies are defined as &#x201C;off the table,&#x201D; in the
        phrase Clintonites deployed to preempt debate over single-payer as a
        goal in early 1990s health care reform, the horizon of properly black
        political aspiration can extend only to pursuit of group parity in the
        distribution of good and bad outcomes in the society, even as it becomes
        increasingly unequal in general. From that perspective, the injustice of
        the subprime mortgage scam lies in the extent to which it targeted
        blacks; the problem with intensifying inequalities of wealth and income
        is that blacks may be disproportionately disadvantaged, and the crucial
        outrage of the criminal justice system&#x2014;from rampant
        carceralization to patterns of policing that authorize law enforcement
        officers to abrogate the Constitution with impunity and to preempt the
        roles of prosecutor, judge, jury, and executioner&#x2014;is that blacks
        are disproportionately victimized in it. This inclination to reduce
        injustice and inequality exclusively to their racial components is
        precisely the reason Michaels, Warren <em>et al</em>. (and, for the
        record, I am one of that essay&#x2019;s co-authors) and others
        characterize contemporary antiracism as a critique entirely within
        bipartisan neoliberalism and therefore a rhetorical and ideological
        legitimation of that larger regime of inequality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Antiracist reactions to Bernie Sanders&#x2019;s challenge and its
        invigoration of a redistributionist left illustrate the extent to which
        this race politics is at bottom a class politics. Dismissal of
        Sanders&#x2019;s agenda and assertions that Social Security, Medicare,
        Medicaid, living wage, and national health care, for example, somehow
        were not black issues underscores that this turn in black politics is
        committed to an agenda restricted to combating racial disparities within
        prevailing structures of inequality. Thus, in its purview economic
        redistribution seems racially inauthentic, but the annual controversies
        over group parity in awards of Oscars, Grammies, and other accolades
        appear as burning social justice issues. Only ideological blinders can
        block out the implication that a fair share of acclaim for Ava DuVernay,
        Nate Parker or Rihanna is, or should be, more important to black
        Americans than general access to decent, secure employment and
        retirement, health care and a vibrant public sector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contemporary antiracist politics hinges on the premise that race, or
        racism, continues to determine the political, social, and economic
        circumstances of black people much as it did at the turn of the
        twentieth century or even earlier, under slavery. That premise underlies
        and drives assertions that, for example, mass incarceration is
        &#x201C;the new Jim Crow&#x201D; or a latter-day slavery.
        DuVernay&#x2019;s documentary, <em>13<sup>th</sup></em
        >, all but argues explicitly that the Thirteenth Amendment&#x2019;s
        clause exempting &#x201C;punishment for crime whereof the party shall
        have been duly convicted&#x201D; from its blanket prohibition of
        involuntary servitude was intended to leave space for reintroducing
        slavery, now through mass incarceration. (To those who may object that
        DuVernay&#x2019;s documentary does not openly make such a claim, I
        submit reports from several colleagues at universities in different
        parts of the country, including my own experience at Penn, of
        undergraduate students who have advanced it explicitly.) Ta-Nehisi
        Coates hammers incessantly on the note that racism or white supremacy is
        a transhistorical, unchanging, and ontological force which white people
        generically are either committed to, driven by, or both and that that
        force&#x2014;an urge to engage in &#x201C;the plunder of black
        bodies&#x201D;&#x2014;is the singular explanation of disadvantage,
        inequality, or injustice experienced by black Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is instructive that Coates and others who argue that racism remains
        the most potent force generating racially invidious inequalities
        commonly invoke superficial analogies with earlier historical moments
        when racial classification much more directly limited black
        people&#x2019;s life chances. They do not attempt to explain
        <em>how</em> racism produces those outcomes in the present; the analogy
        stands in lieu of explanation. Michelle Alexander even acknowledges in
        the book that popularized the &#x201C;new Jim Crow&#x201D; analogy in
        relation to mass incarceration that, when all is said and done, it is
        not an accurate description of current conditions. The objective of
        antiracist politics is less to explain, and thereby inform strategies
        for addressing, the dynamics that generate and reproduce inequalities
        than to assert a claim that &#x201C;racism&#x201D; is the label that
        should attach to any and all injustices affecting black people. So,
        notwithstanding their dismissals of calls for grounding leftist strategy
        on challenging broad economic inequality as &#x201C;class
        reductionist,&#x201D; advocates of contemporary antiracism in fact
        embrace a race reductionism.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a logical contradiction at the core of this form of antiracist
        argument. Analogies to earlier historical moments when racial
        classification directly constrained black people&#x2019;s life chances
        are so central to the reductionist arguments that ground antiracist
        politics because racism is now negatively sanctioned in contemporary
        American culture. It is conventional wisdom today that racism was the
        principal cause, or at least principal justification, of black
        inequality during slavery and southern Jim Crow segregation; slavery and
        imposed racial hierarchy are repugnant to contemporary sensibilities.
        That means, however, that denunciation of current practices or relations
        through analogies to those earlier regimes of injustice seems powerful
        rhetorically precisely because of a presumption that the claim is
        <em>not</em> true. For the claim to have the desired force, those making
        it must assume that things have changed because the charge is
        fundamentally a denunciation of objectionable conditions or incidents as
        atavistic and a call for others to regard them as such.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Yale Law Professor James Forman, Jr.&#xA0;has argued, regarding the
        trope that mass incarceration is a new Jim Crow, such analogies both
        diminish the importance of the victories of the last half-century and
        trivialize the dangers and constraints&#x2014;the concrete
        manifestations of explicitly racial oppression&#x2014;that defined the
        earlier periods. The most superficial knowledge of the past and
        observation of the present should establish that black Americans do not
        live under the same restricted and perilous conditions now as in 1865,
        or for that matter 1965. The contention that racism singularly defines
        black reality is therefore not an empirical claim, even though many
        advancing it seem earnestly convinced that it is. It is a lament that
        racism persists as a force impeding black Americans&#x2019; aspirations,
        that no matter how successful or financially secure individual black
        people may be, they remain similarly subject to victimization by it. The
        claim carries a tacit preface: &#x201C;(this incident/phenomenon/pattern
        makes it seem as though) nothing has changed.&#x201D; In practical
        terms, it is an assertion that race/racism should remain the default
        frame of reference for discussing any and all inequalities bearing on
        black Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Persistence of racialized patterns of inequality and expressions of open
        bigotry give this reductionist perspective a ring of truth, and struggle
        against specifically racial injustice has always been a central
        component of black Americans&#x2019; political activity. In addition,
        for at least a quarter-century political elites, the commentariat, and
        academics have propagated a notion that black politics consists in
        drawing attention to specifically racial injustices, chiefly identifying
        disparities. Even black concerns with issues that affect the population
        across the board, <em>e.g.</em> climate change, nonetheless seem to
        require assertion of a particularly racial impact. The &#x201C;blacks
        have it worse&#x201D; trope is at this point, like an ejaculation in the
        Catholic liturgy, a predictable reflex in political argument centered on
        disparity as the lone truly actionable injustice. Rhetorically, that
        claim is not a call to popular political action but a demand for
        recognition based on moral priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like any ideology that gains traction, race reductionism also has a
        material foundation. Black ethnic politics consolidated around
        exponential growth of a stratum of office holders and public
        functionaries, and it has encouraged and reinforced development of what
        might be called a political economy of race-relations or diversity
        management. That includes a burgeoning, multibillion dollar diversity
        industry that extends to corporations and universities, where pursuit
        and monitoring of diversity is woven into human resource functions and
        overseen by in-house diversity professionals and administrators and
        freelance consultants. Insofar as diversity is valued in personnel
        policies, the significance of this political economy, and the ideology
        that emanates from and underwrites it, ranges far beyond those who work
        in the diversity/race relations economy directly. Diversity as a norm of
        fairness pervades the professional-managerial strata and ratifies an
        ideal of social justice that harmonizes seamlessly with market-driven
        neoliberalism because it combines celebration of difference and
        aggressive pursuit of equality of opportunity, to the exclusion of
        economic redistribution. This is the essential truth reflected in the
        subtitle of Walter Benn Michaels&#x2019;s book,
        <em>The Trouble with Diversity</em>, namely that we&#x2014;at least in
        the professional-managerial strata&#x2014;have come to &#x201C;love
        identity and ignore inequality.&#x201D;
      </p>
      <p>
        The political economy of race relations management has grown
        symbiotically with neoliberalism. The symbiosis may be clearest in the
        privatization, outsourcing, and overall retraction of social services,
        as claims to authentic representation of &#x201C;community&#x201D;
        voices and perspectives factor into criteria for awarding contracts and
        standing in policy processes that are increasingly insulated from
        democratic oversight and accountability. The norm of representation as
        embodiment of appropriate categories of identity gives private and
        nonprofit contractors an easy standard of legitimacy that collapses
        possible differences on policy issues and directions into vacant liberal
        proceduralism (having a &#x201C;seat at the table&#x201D;) and Victorian
        racialist mysticism (&#x201C;reflecting the perspective of the
        X&#x201D;). The symbiotic relationship shows up also in the ways that a
        politics grounded on identity can obfuscate dynamics of economic
        inequality and dispossession by rendering them in cultural terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Debate over displacement for upscaling redevelopment is a case in point.
        In opting for a language of &#x201C;gentrification,&#x201D; opponents of
        displacement, often without intending to do so, cloud a simple,
        straightforward dynamic&#x2014;public support of private
        developers&#x2019; pursuit of rent-intensifying
        redevelopment&#x2014;with cultural implications that shift critique away
        from the issue of using public authority to engineer upward
        redistribution and impose hardship on relatively vulnerable residents.
        Instead, discussion of gentrification slides into objections about
        display of privilege, and lack of recognition or respect that,
        notwithstanding the moral outrage that accompanies them, accept the
        logic of rent-intensifying redevelopment as given and demand that
        newcomers acknowledge and honor aboriginal habitus and practices and
        that the &#x201C;community&#x201D; be involved in the processes of
        upgrading. A similar racial or cultural discourse has unhelpfully shaped
        opposition to charterization of public education by focusing on the
        racial dimension of the process. The fundamental problem with Teach for
        America and such privatizers, after all, is not that the missionaries
        are mainly white and unfamiliar with native culture or even that many of
        them are tourists building extracurriculars for their graduate and
        professional school dossiers. Those are only idiosyncratically
        distasteful features of a particular line of attack on one front in a
        broader war on public goods and the idea of social solidarity in line
        with marketization of all human needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that sort of culturalist discourse also opens opportunities for
        petty, and not so petty, entrepreneurship in the name of respect or
        recognition of the community, within the logic of neoliberalization.
        Race reductionism enables a sleight-of-hand in which benefits to
        individuals can appear to be victories for the generic racial population
        or community. The more deeply embedded a groupist notion of fairness or
        justice becomes as common sense, the more easily that sleight-of-hand
        works under labels like &#x201C;community empowerment,&#x201D;
        &#x201C;voice,&#x201D; &#x201C;opportunity,&#x201D; or
        &#x201C;representation&#x201D; to propel and legitimate accumulation by
        dispossession.
      </p>
      <p>
        The symbiotic relation between antiracist politics and Democratic
        neoliberalism helps to make sense of the vitriol with which so many
        antiracist activists have reacted to Sanders and the renewed interest in
        challenging economic inequality. Notwithstanding copious evocations of
        the heroic period of black insurgent activism, this politics is not
        directed toward generating the deep and broad solidarities necessary for
        building an insurgent political movement. It is an insider, elite-driven
        interest group politics that is concerned less with reducing inequality
        than with establishing and maintaining what Kenneth Warren describes as
        &#x201C;managerial authority over the nation&#x2019;s Negro
        problem.&#x201D; As West observed regarding the race relations
        framework&#x2019;s emergence at the dawn of the twentieth century,
        claims to speak for black concerns in this politics do not depend on
        demonstration of accountability to any specific constituencies of black
        people. From Coates and other pundits to the many random Black Lives
        Matter activists those who expatiate about black Americans&#x2019; lack
        of interest in social-democratic politics claim interpretive authority
        based on the mysticism of organic racial representation and, most
        immediately, recognition by corporate media and elites as authentic
        voices.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is a crucial context within which we should understand
        antiracists&#x2019; tendency to align with Wall Street Democrats in
        denouncing calls for general redistribution and their insistence that
        Trump&#x2019;s victory most meaningfully expresses the depth of
        commitments to white supremacy, sexism, and homophobia particularly
        among &#x201C;white working class&#x201D; voters. The contention that
        working-class disaffection from Clintonite neoliberalism most of all
        expresses backlash against blacks and others is an argument, as
        Clinton&#x2019;s snide dismissal of Sanders indicates, that economic
        inequality is not a central concern for blacks, women, immigrants, LGBT
        or transgender people. A year into the Trump presidency and unimpeded
        Republican control of Congress and of most state governments has
        confirmed what many on the left have known all along, that the
        right&#x2019;s agenda is an all-out attack on working people, no matter
        what their racial and gender classifications and identities or sexual
        orientations. The alliance of Democratic neoliberalism and an
        identity-based notion of social justice has contributed to this
        nightmarish outcome precisely by diminishing the significance of a
        policy orientation that abets upward redistribution and intensifying
        economic inequality and racializing the working class as white losers.
        Doubling down on that approach, as Clintonites and race- and
        gender-reductionists exhort, will not effectively counter the
        right&#x2019;s strategy. The real lesson of 2016 is that we need both to
        mobilize for 2018 and 2020 on a basis that focuses on the concerns and
        anxieties that working people share across those categories of identity
        and to organize for the longer term to cultivate those solidarities as
        part of building a movement that can change the terms of debate to pivot
        on how government can best provide for the security and welfare of the
        vast majority of the population who must work for a living. This means,
        among other things, that we must be confident in rejecting
        claims&#x2014;no matter how flamboyantly adorned they are with moral
        posturing and evocations of past insurgencies&#x2014;that black
        Americans or other nonwhites, immigrants, women, LGBTQ and transgender
        people somehow will spurn access to quality affordable housing, health
        care, education, secure employment with decent wages, benefits and
        rights and protections on the job, and high-quality public goods and
        services as not pertinent to them.
