    <section id="body-text">
      <p>
        At a 1991 conference at the Harvard Law School, where he was a tenured
        full professor, I heard the late, esteemed legal theorist, Derrick Bell,
        declare on a panel that blacks had made no progress since 1865. I was
        startled, not least because Bell’s own life, as well as the fact that
        Harvard’s black law students’ organization put on the conference, so
        emphatically belied his claim. I have since come to understand that
        those who make such claims experience no sense of contradiction because
        the contention that nothing has changed is intended actually as an
        assertion that racism persists as the most consequential force impeding
        black Americans’ aspirations, that no matter how successful or
        financially secure individual black people become, they remain similarly
        subject to victimization by racism.
      </p>
      <p>
        That assertion is not to be taken literally as an empirical claim, even
        though many advancing it seem earnestly convinced that it is; it is
        rhetorical. No sane or at all knowledgeable person can believe that
        black Americans live under the same restricted and perilous conditions
        now as in 1865. The claim therefore carries a silent preface: “(This
        incident/phenomenon/pattern makes it seem as though) nothing has
        changed.” It is more a jeremiad than an analysis and is usually advanced
        in response to some outrage. As I have pointed out elsewhere,<a
          href="#fn1"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref1"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>1</sup></a
        >
        for the claim to have the desired rhetorical force, those making it must
        assume that things <em>have</em> changed because the charge is
        fundamentally a denunciation of objectionable conditions or incidents as
        atavistic and a call for others to regard them as such. Attempting to
        mobilize outrage about some action or expression through associating it
        with discredited and vilified views or practices is a common gambit in
        hortatory political rhetoric, more or less effective for a rally or
        leaflet. But this antiracist politics is ineffective and even
        destructive when it takes the place of scholarly interpretation or
        strategic political analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        New Orleans provides a useful illustration of the limitations of
        contemporary antiracism as a politics. Antiracist political critique
        failed abysmally after Katrina to mobilize significant opposition to
        elimination of low-income public housing or to the ongoing destruction
        of public schools. That politics, which posits an abstract “black
        community” against an equally abstract “racism,” could not provide
        persuasive responses to the blend of underclass ideology that
        stigmatizes public housing as an incubator of a degraded population.<a

        Nevertheless, race-reductionist argument continues to dominate the
        political imagination of those who would challenge structures of
        inequality. It has remained, without critical reflection or strategic
        reassessment, the default stance of putatively insurgent or oppositional
        black politics in the city and was most recently on display in a
        controversy over removal of monuments erected in the late nineteenth and
        early twentieth centuries to celebrate the Confederacy and white
        supremacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spring of 2017, the City, at the mayor’s initiative and with
        support of six of the seven council members, removed from public display
        four odious monuments to the treasonous Confederate insurrection that
        had been a nasty affront to egalitarian values for more than a
        century.<a
          href="#fn3"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref3"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>3</sup></a
        >
        Mayor Mitch Landrieu announced his intention to remove them after South
        Carolina Governor Nikki Haley took down the Confederate battle flag from
        the statehouse grounds, where its presence had been the source of
        long-standing controversy, in the wake of Dylann Roof’s racially
        inspired murder of parishioners at a Charleston black church. Activists
        linked to Black Lives Matter and the Black Youth Project 100 (BYP100), a
        group organized through the Center for the Study of Race, Politics and
        Culture at the University of Chicago, created an
        <em>ad hoc</em> alliance, Take ’Em Down NOLA, to agitate for removal not
        only of the four monuments, but of “all the public symbols—monuments,
        school names, and street signs dedicated to white supremacists.”<a
          href="#fn4"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref4"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>4</sup></a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The city is certainly a better place for being rid of those monuments,
        and having removed them from public display could be a step toward
        finally defeating the Lost Cause/Heritage ideology that remains too
        useful a tool of the right for making class power invisible in both the
        past and the present. But, while the group’s efforts contributed
        appreciably to pressing the issue and mobilizing some public support for
        removal, Take ’Em Down NOLA’s campaign also obscured class power,
        ironically in the same way as did the <em>fin de siècle</em> ruling
        class that erected the monuments. For Take ’Em Down NOLA and other
        antiracist activists, the monuments’ significance is allegorical; they
        are icons representing an abstract, ultimately ontological white
        supremacy that drives and reproduces racial inequality in the present as
        in the past. The monuments, that is, are props in the broader
        race-reductionist discourse that also analogizes contemporary inequality
        to Jim Crow or slavery. Instructively, Take ’Em Down NOLA’s goal is not
        simply to remove every vestige of commemoration, no matter how obscure
        or trivial, of any historical figure associated with the Confederate
        insurrection or slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their hyperbolic contention that the monuments inflict daily
        injury on and “psychologically terrorize” black New Orleanians,<a
          href="#fn5"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref5"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>5</sup></a
        >
        Take ’Em Down NOLA’s agitation for removal is the instrument of a more
        evanescent project. Their goal, as poet and Harvard graduate student
        Clint Smith described it in a <em>New Republic</em> puff piece, is “an
        ongoing attempt to foster an honest reckoning with the past.” As to what
        that honest reckoning might look like or produce, neither he nor they
        have much concrete to say. “Entirely erasing tributes to the confederacy
        from New Orleans might never happen,” Smith allows, “but the work of
        Take ’Em Down NOLA forces us to consider what it might say about us if
        we did—and what it says about the fact that we have not yet done so.”<a
          href="#fn6"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref6"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>6</sup></a
        >
        That is, the group’s agitation is driven more by demanding that “racism”
        be recognized as the source of inequality than by pursuing specific
        policy goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a feature of contemporary antiracist discourse generally.
        Antiracist activism and scholarship proceed from the view that
        statistical disparities in the distribution by race of goods and bads in
        the society in which blacks appear worse-off categorically
        (<em>e.g.</em>, less wealth, higher rates of unemployment, greater
        incidence of hypertensive and cardiovascular disease) amount to evidence
        that “race” remains fundamentally determinative of black Americans’
        lives. As Merlin Chowkwanyun and I argue, however, disparity is an
        outcome, not an explanation, and deducing cause simplistically from
        outcome (<em>e.g.</em>, treating racially disparate outcomes as
        <em>ipso facto</em> evidence of racially invidious causation) seems
        sufficient only if one has already stacked the interpretive deck in
        favor of a particular causal account.<a
          href="#fn7"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref7"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>7</sup></a
        >
        We also discuss a “garbage in, garbage out” effect in studies that rely
        on large-scale aggregate data analysis; gross categories like race may
        mask significant micro-level dynamics that could present more complex
        and nuanced understandings of causality. Put another way, if you go out
        looking for racial effects in data sets that are organized by race as
        gross categories, you will be likely to find them, but that will not
        necessarily lead to sound interpretations of the factors that actually
        produce the inequalities. As likely as not that purblind approach can
        lead to missing “the extent to which particular inequalities that appear
        statistically as ‘racial’ disparities are in fact embedded in multiple
        social relations.”<a
          href="#fn8"
          class="footnote-ref"

          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>8</sup></a
        >
        This issue is not a concern for antiracist politics because its
        fundamental goal is propagation of the view that inequalities or
        injustices suffered by black Americans should be understood as resulting
        from generic white racism. Its objective, that is, is rhetorical and
        ideological, not political and programmatic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Antiracist discourse posits white supremacy/racism as a totalizing
        phenomenon, a force impervious to changing institutional circumstances—a
        primordial foundation of being, just as the White League contended in
        the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The thrust of the Take ’Em
        Down NOLA argument, for example, is that: (1) the monuments were erected
        to celebrate white supremacist power, which was the foundation of
        slavery, lynching and brutalization of black New Orleanians,
        disfranchisement, imposition of Jim Crow, and denial of blacks’ basic
        civil rights; (2) the fact that they remain on display in the present
        underscores the continuity of white supremacy’s power; and (3) that
        continuity indicates that, as in the past, contemporary racial
        inequalities most meaningfully result from white supremacy, which
        therefore must be the primary target of struggles for social and racial
        justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        But adducing a causal dynamic that underlay a political conjuncture in
        the past to support a claim about causality in the present
        <em>presumes</em> that the same dynamics operated in the past and
        present. That is, the race-reductionist formulation advanced to validate
        the claim of white supremacy’s overarching power presumes what it needs
        to demonstrate. Sociologist Mara Loveman follows Rogers Brubaker, Pierre
        Bourdieu, and others in arguing that this interpretive problem and the
        confusions that generate it can be addressed by “abandoning ‘race’ as a
        category of analysis to gain analytical leverage to study ‘race’ as a
        category of practice.”<a
          href="#fn9"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref9"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>9</sup></a
        >
        She embraces historian Barbara J. Fields’s assessment that “attempts to
        explain ‘racial phenomena’ in terms of ‘race’ are no more than
        definitional statements,” and argues that “rejection of ‘race’ as an
        analytical concept facilitates analysis of the historical construction
        of ‘race’ as a practical category without reification, and thus provides
        a degree of analytical leverage that tends to be foreclosed when race is
        used analytically.”<a
          href="#fn10"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref10"

      </p>
      <p>
        In the current political context that interpretive pathology is
        pernicious politically because the claim of continuity demands ignoring
        historical specificities of both past and present that are crucially
        important for making adequate sense of either. The point of analogizing
        current conditions to slavery or earlier regimes of openly white
        supremacist hierarchy is to subordinate consideration of the discrete,
        complex mechanisms through which contemporary inequalities are
        reproduced in quotidian life to the meta-historical contention that
        generic white supremacy, or racism, most significantly explains
        disadvantages and injustices that black Americans suffer today. But even
        in the nineteenth century, at the nadir of the defeat of Reconstruction
        and imposition of disfranchisement and the Jim Crow order, black
        politics was not adequately reducible to a unitary struggle against
        white supremacy; differences of perspective, agendas, and programs
        pertained among blacks and determined strategic directions, including
        pursuit of allies.<a

        In addressing another racially charged issue—how we should regard Rachel
        Dolezal’s embrace of a transracial identity in relation to Caitlyn
        Jenner’s embrace of a transgender one—historian Susan Stryker neatly
        describes the appeal and limitations of argument by analogy:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Analogy is a weak form of analysis, in which a better-known case is
          compared to one that is lesser known, and thereby offered as a model
          for understanding something that is not yet well understood… Analogy’s
          rhetorical strength is to be found precisely in its ability to
          condense complicated forms of similarity into singularly powerful
          linguistic gestures and acts of speech, while its analytical weakness
          lies precisely in the non-identity of the things being compared.<a
            href="#fn12"
            class="footnote-ref"
            id="fnref12"
            role="doc-noteref"
            ><sup>12</sup></a
          >
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Even if we were to accept “racism” as a label summarizing the various
        factors involved, noting those apparent similarities does not tell us
        <em>how</em> inequalities are reproduced today and has nothing to say
        practically about how to combat them. And it is important to interrogate
        why it is paramount within the antiracist framework that we understand
        the present through analogy to the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the antiracist political project white supremacy/racism is—like
        “terrorism”—an amorphous, ideological abstraction whose specific content
        exists largely in the eyes of the beholder. Therefore, like
        antiterrorism, antiracism’s targets can be porous and entirely
        arbitrary; this means that, also like antiterrorism, the struggle can
        never be won. Clint Smith’s romantic assessment of Take ’Em Down NOLA’s
        contribution indicates as much and makes clear, as does everything that
        Ta-Nehisi Coates has ever written,<a
          href="#fn13"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref13"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>13</sup></a
        >
        that winning anything concrete is not the point. The “politics” that
        follows from this view centers on pursuit of recognition and
        representation on groupist terms—both as symbolic depiction in the
        public realm and as claims to articulate the interests, perspectives, or
        “voices” of a generic black constituency or some subset thereof,
        <em>e.g.</em>, “youth” or “grassroots.” It is not interested in broadly
        egalitarian redistribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding its performative evocations of the 1960s Black Power
        populist “militancy,” this antiracist politics is neither leftist in
        itself nor particularly compatible with a left politics as
        conventionally understood. At this political juncture, it is, like
        bourgeois feminism and other groupist tendencies, an oppositional
        epicycle <em>within</em> hegemonic neoliberalism, one might say a
        component of neoliberalism’s critical self-consciousness; it is thus in
        fact fundamentally <em>anti</em>-leftist. Black political elites’
        attacks on the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential nomination campaign’s
        call for decommodified public higher education as frivolous,
        irresponsible, or even un-American underscores how deeply embedded this
        politics is within neoliberalism.<a
          href="#fn14"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref14"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>14</sup></a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        During the campaign, antiracist activists and commentators routinely
        attacked Sanders for being inattentive to black concerns, which they
        insisted are separate from political economy and capitalist class
        dynamics and reduced to <em>pro forma</em> rehearsal of slogans like
        “black lives matter” and denunciation of an abstract “systemic racism.”
        After the 2016 election, antiracist hostility toward efforts to generate
        broadly working class-based, social-democratic alternatives to
        Democratic neoliberalism, if anything, intensified. Coates, for example,
        denounces as white supremacist any suggestion that working-class whites’
        votes for Trump stem from anything other than commitment to white
        supremacy.<a
          href="#fn15"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref15"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>15</sup></a
        >
        Social scientists and other public opinion experts have provided steady
        grist for antiracist and other identitiarian ideologues’ incessant
        rehearsal of the trope of a hopelessly backward, racist, sexist,
        homophobic, and xenophobic white working class as the main danger to
        progress in society. In this insistence, they join Clintonoid neoliberal
        Democrats of all races, genders, and sexual orientations who reject
        downwardly redistributive politics for more openly class-based reasons.
        Thus, as Mark Dudzic points out in a superb essay originally written
        before the election:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Joan Walsh, among many others, opined that Sanders’ substantial
          support among white workers (who overwhelmingly supported Clinton in
          2008) is because “she has been damaged by her association with the
          first black president.” And Paul Krugman, that eternal guardian of the
          left gate of the ruling class, pontificated that the Sanders campaign
          failed to understand the importance of “horizontal inequality” between
          groups.<a
            href="#fn16"
            class="footnote-ref"

        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Dudzic’s assessment of liberals’ reaction to the social-democratic
        enthusiasm Sanders sparked applies equally to antiracist activists and
        commentators:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The Sanders campaign was so disorienting to both conservatives and
          liberals because it did not embrace these naturalized categories
          [racism and sexism] but, instead, revealed them as social
          relationships established by real human beings and, thus, open to
          change through the application of political and economic policies.
          After stumbling a bit in the early months around how to give voice to
          the outrages of police violence and mass incarceration, it laid out a
          working-class politics of hope that was both visionary and practical.
          In the process, it helped lay bare the actual mechanisms of capitalism
          that drive inequality. And it exposed the fault lines created by
          decades of neoliberalism that are impeding real change in the labor,
          racial justice and other social movements.<a

        Although its attraction to Black Power “militancy” suggests insurgent
        racial populism, the current race-reductionist politics centers on
        exposé and demands for recognition, not egalitarian redistribution. Its
        project is elimination of disparities <em>within</em> a regime of
        intensifying economic inequality, which antiracism takes as given. As
        Warren <em>et al</em>. put it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Antiracists … remain attuned to a vision of justice defined by
          ensuring equal access to hierarchically distributed social goods such
          as family wealth (and redressing historical impediments to the
          accumulation of wealth rooted in discrimination). Indeed in making
          frequent recourse to the adjective “narrow” in chastising a politics
          that roots inequality in economic exploitation, antiracists and
          identitarians have positioned the idea of racial justice as a critique
          of, rather than an expected consequence of, socialism. It is largely
          for this reason that, as Walter Benn Michaels has noted … “the
          commitment to identity politics has been more an expression of …
          enthusiasm for the free market than a form of resistance to it.”<a

        Even when its proponents believe themselves to be radicals, this
        antiracist politics is a professional-managerial class politics. Its
        adherents are not concerned with trying to generate the large, broad
        political base needed to pursue a transformative agenda because they are
        committed fundamentally to pursuit of racial parity within
        neoliberalism, not social transformation. In fact, antiracist activists’
        and pundits’ insistence during the 2016 election campaign that Bernie
        Sanders did not address black concerns made that point very clearly
        because nearly every item on the Sanders campaign’s policy agenda—from
        the Robin Hood tax on billionaires to free public higher education to
        the $15/hr minimum wage, a single-payer health care system,
        <em>etc</em>.—would disproportionately benefit black and Hispanic
        populations that are disproportionately working-class.

      <p>
        Most of all, the gains that black Americans have won have been the
        product of alliances condensed around broad egalitarian agendas.
        Historian Touré F. Reed notes:

          Emancipation and even Reconstruction were produced by a convergence of
          interests among disparate constituencies—African Americans,
          abolitionists, business, small freeholders, and northern
          laborers—united under the banner of free labor. The civil rights
          movement was the product of a consensus created by the New Deal that
          presumed the appropriateness of government intervention in private
          affairs for the public good, the broad repudiation of scientific
          racism following World War II, and the political vulnerabilities Jim
          Crow created for the United States during the Cold War. To be sure,
          Reconstruction, the New Deal, the War on Poverty, and even the civil
          rights movement failed to redress all of the challenges confronting
          blacks. But the limitations of each of these movements reflected
          political constraints imposed on them, in large part, by capital.<a

        <em>What the Negro Wants</em>—understood, first, the exploitation and
        oppression of black Americans was linked to more general dynamics of

        That lesson has been lost for many antiracist activists and commentators
        enamored with contemporary race reductionism; instead, they channel the
        performative militancy associated with Black Power politics as the
        insurgent, racially authentic tendency in the late 1960s and 1970s.

        Black Power politics was fundamentally a petition politics, albeit a
        loud and flamboyant one. For all their overheated rhetoric about
        self-determination, including even in some cases what now might be
        called cosplay fantasies of armed struggle, Black Powerites generally
        depended on ruling class largesse for realization of their programmatic
        objectives. That was their alternative to trying to form broad, popular
        coalitions and to navigate the compromises and constraints that sort of
        politics requires. As a practical politics, Black Power was
        fundamentally directed toward government institutions, private or
        philanthropic funding sources, and other agencies capable of conferring
        or ratifying claims to represent a generic “black community” (some
        referred to the style at the time as “militant begging”; I suppose today
        it could be considered an institutional species of aggressive
        panhandling). Contemporaneous critics like Harold Cruse and Robert L.
        Allen pointed out the Black Power program’s class character,<a

        Black Power, at least in the ethnic pluralist form in which it congealed
        as “black politics,” was at bottom a Bookerite politics of
        elite-brokerage, as is the essence of ethnic pluralism. The core
        Bookerite project, under the rubric of racial uplift or advancement, has
        always been—since Washington and the stratum of black racial advocates
        that emerged from the context of disfranchisement at the turn of the
        twentieth century—“substitution of black professionals, managers, and
        intellectuals for their white counterparts within those institutions
        charged with administering to the needs of black populations.” The
        political goal, that is, was establishment of “managerial authority of
        the nation’s Negro problem” within whatever larger political and
        economic order prevailed.<a

        Warren’s critique, which he elaborated further in
        <em>What Was African American Literature</em> (2012), sheds light on
        contemporary antiracists’ singular commitment to the reductionist view
        that race/racism is the foundation and source of all injustice and
        inequality affecting black Americans.<a

        It also thus helps to make sense of the affective power that explaining
        current inequalities through analogy to slavery or Jim Crow has in
        antiracist discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Antiracist politics is a class politics; it is rooted in the social
        position and worldview, and material interests of the stratum of race
        relations engineers and administrators who operate in Democratic party
        politics and as government functionaries, the punditry and commentariat,
        education administration and the professoriate, corporate, social
        service and nonprofit sectors, and the multibillion-dollar diversity
        industry. That stratum comes together around a common sense commitment
        to the centrality of race—and other categories of ascriptive identity—as
        the appropriate discursive framework through which to articulate norms
        of justice and injustice and through which to formulate remedial
        responses. It has grown and become deeply embedded institutionally
        throughout society as an entailment of the victories of the 1960s. As
        society moves further away from the regime of subordination and
        exclusion on explicitly racial terms to which race-reductionist
        explanations were an immediately plausible response, race has become
        less potent as the dominant metaphor, or blanket shorthand, through
        which class hierarchy is lived. And as black and white elites
        increasingly go through the same schools, live in the same
        neighborhoods, operate as peers in integrated workplaces, and share and
        interact in the same social spaces and consumption practices and
        preferences, they increasingly share another common sense, not only
        about frameworks of public policy but about the proper order of things
        in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those quotidian realities put pressure on the reductionist premise that
        racial subordination remains the dominant ideological or material
        framework generating and sustaining systemically reproduced inequalities
        and class power. This tension underlies a source of the appeal of
        ontological views of racism as an animate force that transcends time and
        context. Because it is an evanescent Evil that is disconnected from
        specific human purposes and patterns of social relations, racism, again
        like “terrorism,” can exist anywhere at any time under any manifest
        conditions and is a cause that needs no causes or explanation. That is
        why statistical demonstration of apparent racial disparities seems
        within antiracist discourse to be self-sufficient evidence of the
        persistence of racism’s paramount impact on black Americans, despite the
        fact that findings of disparity: (1) are not surprising considering how
        entrenched inequalities work; (2) do not tell us much, if anything,
        about the proximate sources of the disparities; and (3) do not point to
        remedial responses, although those retailing the findings often present
        them as though they do. As Chowkwanyun and I indicate, moreover,
        relentless commitment to finding disparities, and insistence that
        manifest inequalities be understood in those terms despite those
        interpretive failings, suggests the presence of other ideological
        factors:

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          [Disparitarian discourse’s] commitment to a fundamentally essentialist
          and ahistorical race-first view is betrayed in the constantly
          expanding panoply of neologisms—“institutional racism,” “systemic
          racism,” “structural racism,” “colourblind racism,” “post-racial
          racism,” <em>etc</em>.—intended to graft more complex social dynamics
          onto a simplistic and frequently psychologistic racism/antiracism
          political ontology. Indeed, these efforts bring to mind [Thomas]
          Kuhn’s account of attempts to accommodate mounting anomalies to
          salvage an interpretive paradigm in danger of crumbling under a crisis
          of authority. And in this circumstance as well the salvage effort is
          driven by powerful material and ideological imperatives.<a

        That ontological view of racism is what enabled Bell’s insistence that
        nothing has changed for black Americans since 1865 without having to
        confront the apparently disconfirming evidence of his own biography and
        the context of his declaration. It also underlies the preference for
        invoking historical analogies in lieu of argument. The point of those
        analogies is not to explain the mechanisms through which contemporary
        inequalities are reproduced. It is to preserve the interpretive
        framework that identifies racism as the definitive source of those
        inequalities.

        Antiracism’s class character helps to understand why its adherents are
        so intensely committed to it even though it is so deeply flawed
        analytically and has generated so little popular traction politically.
        One layer of its appeal derives simply from habit, buttressed with a
        simulacrum of familiarity engendered by the naïve conceptions of black
        political history that prompted Willie Legette’s deathless observation
        that “the only thing that hasn’t changed about black politics since 1965
        is how we think about it.”<a

        People think about black politics as a unitary, transhistorical “freedom
        movement” or “liberation struggle” because that is how scholarly and
        popular discussion of black Americans’ political activity has been
        framed almost universally since the academic study of black politics and
        political thought took shape during the 1950s and 1960s, and especially
        after the institutionalization of black studies as a field in the
        academic mainstream through the 1970s to the 1990s. The guild interest
        in carving out and protecting the boundaries of a field of study and
        interpretive authority over its subject matter converges with the
        broader class interest in maintaining managerial and interpretive
        authority in the political economy of race relations.<a

        Crucial to making sense of the current political moment and how to
        navigate the real perils that face us after November 2016 is recognition
        that, no matter how it may have been aligned in the past, antiracist
        politics now is fundamentally antagonistic to a left politics of broadly
        egalitarian social transformation. Key elements of the black
        professional-managerial strata have been embedded in and are agents and
        minions of what we now call neoliberalism—as public functionaries,
        contractors, and aspirants—since its emergence in the 1970s and 1980s.
        In the 1980s and 1990s, underclass ideology rationalized claims to a
        special tutelary role for the black professional-managerial class in
        relation to a rank-and-file black population that that politics rendered
        invisible as postal workers, teachers, truck drivers, carpenters,
        clerks, warehouse workers, electricians or line workers, nurses, cable
        technicians, <em>etc</em>. or members of a constantly expanding
        industrial reserve army and represented as an undifferentiated mass to
        be ventriloquized and “uplifted.” Underclass ideology came with a remedy
        of inculcating “personal responsibility,” which conveniently permits
        public officials to deflect concerns with retreat from social service
        provision and other social wage policies in an era increasingly defined
        by regressive transfer. Neoliberal privatization also has produced
        greatly expanded commercial and career opportunities for black (and
        Latino, female, <em>etc</em>.) entrepreneurs under the rubric of
        community “empowerment,” “role modeling,” or “social entrepreneurialism”
        in a vast third-sector economy driven by a nonprofit sector likely as
        not committed to privatizing public goods in the name of localist
        authenticity and doing well by doing good, as well as the steadily
        growing diversity industry. These developments legitimate an ideal of
        social justice shriveled to little more than enhancement of opportunity
        for individual upward mobility—within the strictures of neoliberal
        accumulation by dispossession.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black professional-managerial class embeddedness has become increasingly
        solidified with the Clinton/Obama/Emanuel wing of the Democratic party’s
        aggressive commitment to a left-neoliberalism centered on advancement of
        Wall Street and Silicon Valley economic interests and strong support for
        social justice defined in identity group terms. But that is necessarily
        a notion of social justice and equality that is disconnected from
        political economy and the capitalist class dynamics that generate the
        most profound inequalities in society. And militant opposition to
        conventional left norms of justice that center on economic equality
        unites the Clintonite neoliberal Democrats and race-reductionist
        antiracists. In this regard, the most telling moments of the 2016
        Democratic presidential nomination campaign included when the random,
        self-selected Black Lives Matter activists attacked Sanders for
        supposedly not declaring his opposition to racism in a way that suited
        their tastes, and when former civil rights movement icon Rep. John Lewis
        (D-GA) and other prominent black functionaries denounced Sanders’s calls
        for greatly expanding social wage policy and shifting national
        priorities toward addressing the needs of working people as
        irresponsible. Perhaps most telling of all, though, was when, and most
        of all <em>how</em>, Hillary Clinton blithely and disingenuously blew
        off Sanders’s concerns with economic injustice. On the eve of the Nevada
        primary, she declared to a rally of her supporters, “Not everything is
        about an economic theory, right? If we broke up the big banks
        tomorrow—and I will, if they deserve it, if they pose a systemic risk, I
        will—would that end racism? Would that end sexism? Would that end
        discrimination against the LGBT community? Would that make people feel
        more welcoming to immigrants overnight? Would that solve our problem
        with voting rights, and Republicans who are trying to strip them away
        from people of color, the elderly, the young?”<a

      <p>
        Since the election, that alliance against class politics has become even
        more aggressive in red-baiting Sanders and the left via a new sort of
        race-baiting—attacking socialism, and advocates of socialism or
        social-democratic politics, as racist or white supremacist. It has
        closed ranks around condemnation of working-class whites who voted for
        Trump as loathsome and irredeemable racists with whom political
        solidarity is indefensible and in the process reducing “working class”
        to a white racial category and synonym for backwardness and bigotry.
        Antiracists and neoliberal Democrats unite in high moral dudgeon to
        denounce suggestions that more than racism operated to generate the
        Trump vote and that some working people, particularly those whom Les
        Leopold describes as Obama/Sanders/Trump voters—and not necessarily only
        white ones—felt betrayed by both parties.<a

        The practical upshot of that moral stance is that there can be no
        political alternative outside neoliberalism. That is why it is
        important, as we look toward the daunting prospect of building a
        movement capable of changing the terms of debate in American politics to
        center the interests and concerns of working people—of all races,
        genders, sexual orientations, and whatever immigration status—who are
        the vast majority of the country, that we recognize that
        race-reductionist politics is the left wing of neoliberalism and nothing
        more. It is openly antagonistic to the idea of a solidaristic left. It
        is more important than ever to acknowledge that reality and act
        accordingly.

            The monuments were to the confederate insurrection’s commanding
            general, Robert E. Lee; the insurrectionist Confederacy’s president,
            Jefferson Davis; rebel general P. G. T. Beauregard, who had New
            Orleans connections; and commemoration of the Crescent City White
            League’s armed, explicitly racist revolt against the city’s
            Reconstruction government. The White League, which was the terrorist
            face of the local Democratic party, represented itself as defending
            a “hereditary civilization and Christianity menaced by a stupid
            Africanization,” and in 1932 the city added an inscription to the
            commemorative obelisk, erected in 1891, that praised the
            insurrection in explicitly white-supremacist terms. All the
            monuments were erected between 1884 (Lee) and 1915 (Beauregard), the
            precise period of white supremacist consolidation. Reed, Adolph Jr.,
