    <section id="body-text">
      <p>
        At a 1991 conference at the Harvard Law School, where he was a tenured
        full professor, I heard the late, esteemed legal theorist, Derrick Bell,
        declare on a panel that blacks had made no progress since 1865. I was
        startled, not least because Bell&#x2019;s own life, as well as the fact
        that Harvard&#x2019;s black law students&#x2019; organization put on the
        conference, so emphatically belied his claim. I have since come to
        understand that those who make such claims experience no sense of
        contradiction because the contention that nothing has changed is
        intended actually as an assertion that racism persists as the most
        consequential force impeding black Americans&#x2019; aspirations, that
        no matter how successful or financially secure individual black people
        become, they remain similarly subject to victimization by racism.
      </p>
      <p>
        That assertion is not to be taken literally as an empirical claim, even
        though many advancing it seem earnestly convinced that it is; it is
        rhetorical. No sane or at all knowledgeable person can believe that
        black Americans live under the same restricted and perilous conditions
        now as in 1865. The claim therefore carries a silent preface:
        &#x201C;(This incident/phenomenon/pattern makes it seem as though)
        nothing has changed.&#x201D; It is more a jeremiad than an analysis and
        is usually advanced in response to some outrage. As I have pointed out
        elsewhere,<a
          href="#fn1"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref1"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>1</sup></a
        >
        for the claim to have the desired rhetorical force, those making it must
        assume that things <em>have</em> changed because the charge is
        fundamentally a denunciation of objectionable conditions or incidents as
        atavistic and a call for others to regard them as such. Attempting to
        mobilize outrage about some action or expression through associating it
        with discredited and vilified views or practices is a common gambit in
        hortatory political rhetoric, more or less effective for a rally or
        leaflet. But this antiracist politics is ineffective and even
        destructive when it takes the place of scholarly interpretation or
        strategic political analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        New Orleans provides a useful illustration of the limitations of
        contemporary antiracism as a politics. Antiracist political critique
        failed abysmally after Katrina to mobilize significant opposition to
        elimination of low-income public housing or to the ongoing destruction
        of public schools. That politics, which posits an abstract &#x201C;black
        community&#x201D; against an equally abstract &#x201C;racism,&#x201D;
        could not provide persuasive responses to the blend of underclass
        ideology that stigmatizes public housing as an incubator of a degraded
        population.<a

        Nevertheless, race-reductionist argument continues to dominate the
        political imagination of those who would challenge structures of
        inequality. It has remained, without critical reflection or strategic
        reassessment, the default stance of putatively insurgent or oppositional
        black politics in the city and was most recently on display in a
        controversy over removal of monuments erected in the late nineteenth and
        early twentieth centuries to celebrate the Confederacy and white
        supremacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spring of 2017, the City, at the mayor&#x2019;s initiative and
        with support of six of the seven council members, removed from public
        display four odious monuments to the treasonous Confederate insurrection
        that had been a nasty affront to egalitarian values for more than a
        century.<a
          href="#fn3"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref3"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>3</sup></a

        Mayor Mitch Landrieu announced his intention to remove them after South
        Carolina Governor Nikki Haley took down the Confederate battle flag from
        the statehouse grounds, where its presence had been the source of
        long-standing controversy, in the wake of Dylann Roof&#x2019;s racially
        inspired murder of parishioners at a Charleston black church. Activists
        linked to Black Lives Matter and the Black Youth Project 100 (BYP100), a
        group organized through the Center for the Study of Race, Politics and
        Culture at the University of Chicago, created an
        <em>ad hoc</em> alliance, Take &#x2019;Em Down NOLA, to agitate for
        removal not only of the four monuments, but of &#x201C;all the public
        symbols&#x2014;monuments, school names, and street signs dedicated to
        white supremacists.&#x201D;<a
          href="#fn4"
          class="footnote-ref"
          id="fnref4"
          role="doc-noteref"
          ><sup>4</sup></a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        The city is certainly a better place for being rid of those monuments,
        and having removed them from public display could be a step toward
        finally defeating the Lost Cause/Heritage ideology that remains too
        useful a tool of the right for making class power invisible in both the
        past and the present. But, while the group&#x2019;s efforts contributed
        appreciably to pressing the issue and mobilizing some public support for
        removal, Take &#x2019;Em Down NOLA&#x2019;s campaign also obscured class
        power, ironically in the same way as did the
        <em>fin de si&#xE8;cle</em> ruling class that erected the monuments. For
        Take &#x2019;Em Down NOLA and other antiracist activists, the
        monuments&#x2019; significance is allegorical; they are icons
        representing an abstract, ultimately ontological white supremacy that
        drives and reproduces racial inequality in the present as in the past.
        The monuments, that is, are props in the broader race-reductionist
        discourse that also analogizes contemporary inequality to Jim Crow or
        slavery. Instructively, Take &#x2019;Em Down NOLA&#x2019;s goal is not
        simply to remove every vestige of commemoration, no matter how obscure
        or trivial, of any historical figure associated with the Confederate
        insurrection or slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite their hyperbolic contention that the monuments inflict daily
        injury on and &#x201C;psychologically terrorize&#x201D; black New
        Orleanians,<a
          href="#fn5"

          ><sup>5</sup></a
        >
        Take &#x2019;Em Down NOLA&#x2019;s agitation for removal is the
        instrument of a more evanescent project. Their goal, as poet and Harvard
        graduate student Clint Smith described it in a
        <em>New Republic</em> puff piece, is &#x201C;an ongoing attempt to
        foster an honest reckoning with the past.&#x201D; As to what that honest
        reckoning might look like or produce, neither he nor they have much
        concrete to say. &#x201C;Entirely erasing tributes to the confederacy
        from New Orleans might never happen,&#x201D; Smith allows, &#x201C;but
        the work of Take &#x2019;Em Down NOLA forces us to consider what it
        might say about us if we did&#x2014;and what it says about the fact that
        we have not yet done so.&#x201D;<a

          ><sup>6</sup></a

        That is, the group&#x2019;s agitation is driven more by demanding that
        &#x201C;racism&#x201D; be recognized as the source of inequality than by
        pursuing specific policy goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a feature of contemporary antiracist discourse generally.
        Antiracist activism and scholarship proceed from the view that
        statistical disparities in the distribution by race of goods and bads in
        the society in which blacks appear worse-off categorically
        (<em>e.g.</em>, less wealth, higher rates of unemployment, greater
        incidence of hypertensive and cardiovascular disease) amount to evidence
        that &#x201C;race&#x201D; remains fundamentally determinative of black
        Americans&#x2019; lives. As Merlin Chowkwanyun and I argue, however,
        disparity is an outcome, not an explanation, and deducing cause
        simplistically from outcome (<em>e.g.</em>, treating racially disparate
        outcomes as <em>ipso facto</em> evidence of racially invidious
        causation) seems sufficient only if one has already stacked the
        interpretive deck in favor of a particular causal account.<a
          href="#fn7"
          class="footnote-ref"

        >
        We also discuss a &#x201C;garbage in, garbage out&#x201D; effect in
        studies that rely on large-scale aggregate data analysis; gross
        categories like race may mask significant micro-level dynamics that
        could present more complex and nuanced understandings of causality. Put
        another way, if you go out looking for racial effects in data sets that
        are organized by race as gross categories, you will be likely to find
        them, but that will not necessarily lead to sound interpretations of the
        factors that actually produce the inequalities. As likely as not that
        purblind approach can lead to missing &#x201C;the extent to which
        particular inequalities that appear statistically as
        &#x2018;racial&#x2019; disparities are in fact embedded in multiple
        social relations.&#x201D;<a

        This issue is not a concern for antiracist politics because its
        fundamental goal is propagation of the view that inequalities or
        injustices suffered by black Americans should be understood as resulting
        from generic white racism. Its objective, that is, is rhetorical and
        ideological, not political and programmatic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Antiracist discourse posits white supremacy/racism as a totalizing
        phenomenon, a force impervious to changing institutional
        circumstances&#x2014;a primordial foundation of being, just as the White
        League contended in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. The
        thrust of the Take &#x2019;Em Down NOLA argument, for example, is that:
        (1) the monuments were erected to celebrate white supremacist power,
        which was the foundation of slavery, lynching and brutalization of black
        New Orleanians, disfranchisement, imposition of Jim Crow, and denial of
        blacks&#x2019; basic civil rights; (2) the fact that they remain on
        display in the present underscores the continuity of white
        supremacy&#x2019;s power; and (3) that continuity indicates that, as in
        the past, contemporary racial inequalities most meaningfully result from
        white supremacy, which therefore must be the primary target of struggles
        for social and racial justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        But adducing a causal dynamic that underlay a political conjuncture in
        the past to support a claim about causality in the present
        <em>presumes</em> that the same dynamics operated in the past and
        present. That is, the race-reductionist formulation advanced to validate
        the claim of white supremacy&#x2019;s overarching power presumes what it
        needs to demonstrate. Sociologist Mara Loveman follows Rogers Brubaker,
        Pierre Bourdieu, and others in arguing that this interpretive problem
        and the confusions that generate it can be addressed by
        &#x201C;abandoning &#x2018;race&#x2019; as a category of analysis to
        gain analytical leverage to study &#x2018;race&#x2019; as a category of
        practice.&#x201D;<a

        She embraces historian Barbara J. Fields&#x2019;s assessment that
        &#x201C;attempts to explain &#x2018;racial phenomena&#x2019; in terms of
        &#x2018;race&#x2019; are no more than definitional statements,&#x201D;
        and argues that &#x201C;rejection of &#x2018;race&#x2019; as an
        analytical concept facilitates analysis of the historical construction
        of &#x2018;race&#x2019; as a practical category without reification, and
        thus provides a degree of analytical leverage that tends to be
        foreclosed when race is used analytically.&#x201D;<a

        In the current political context that interpretive pathology is
        pernicious politically because the claim of continuity demands ignoring
        historical specificities of both past and present that are crucially
        important for making adequate sense of either. The point of analogizing
        current conditions to slavery or earlier regimes of openly white
        supremacist hierarchy is to subordinate consideration of the discrete,
        complex mechanisms through which contemporary inequalities are
        reproduced in quotidian life to the meta-historical contention that
        generic white supremacy, or racism, most significantly explains
        disadvantages and injustices that black Americans suffer today. But even
        in the nineteenth century, at the nadir of the defeat of Reconstruction
        and imposition of disfranchisement and the Jim Crow order, black
        politics was not adequately reducible to a unitary struggle against
        white supremacy; differences of perspective, agendas, and programs
        pertained among blacks and determined strategic directions, including
        pursuit of allies.<a

        In addressing another racially charged issue&#x2014;how we should regard
        Rachel Dolezal&#x2019;s embrace of a transracial identity in relation to
        Caitlyn Jenner&#x2019;s embrace of a transgender one&#x2014;historian
        Susan Stryker neatly describes the appeal and limitations of argument by
        analogy:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Analogy is a weak form of analysis, in which a better-known case is
          compared to one that is lesser known, and thereby offered as a model
          for understanding something that is not yet well understood&#x2026;
          Analogy&#x2019;s rhetorical strength is to be found precisely in its
          ability to condense complicated forms of similarity into singularly
          powerful linguistic gestures and acts of speech, while its analytical
          weakness lies precisely in the non-identity of the things being
          compared.<a

      <p>
        Even if we were to accept &#x201C;racism&#x201D; as a label summarizing
        the various factors involved, noting those apparent similarities does
        not tell us <em>how</em> inequalities are reproduced today and has
        nothing to say practically about how to combat them. And it is important
        to interrogate why it is paramount within the antiracist framework that
        we understand the present through analogy to the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the antiracist political project white supremacy/racism
        is&#x2014;like &#x201C;terrorism&#x201D;&#x2014;an amorphous,
        ideological abstraction whose specific content exists largely in the
        eyes of the beholder. Therefore, like antiterrorism, antiracism&#x2019;s
        targets can be porous and entirely arbitrary; this means that, also like
        antiterrorism, the struggle can never be won. Clint Smith&#x2019;s
        romantic assessment of Take &#x2019;Em Down NOLA&#x2019;s contribution
        indicates as much and makes clear, as does everything that Ta-Nehisi
        Coates has ever written,<a

        that winning anything concrete is not the point. The
        &#x201C;politics&#x201D; that follows from this view centers on pursuit
        of recognition and representation on groupist terms&#x2014;both as
        symbolic depiction in the public realm and as claims to articulate the
        interests, perspectives, or &#x201C;voices&#x201D; of a generic black
        constituency or some subset thereof, <em>e.g.</em>,
        &#x201C;youth&#x201D; or &#x201C;grassroots.&#x201D; It is not
        interested in broadly egalitarian redistribution.

      <p>
        Notwithstanding its performative evocations of the 1960s Black Power
        populist &#x201C;militancy,&#x201D; this antiracist politics is neither
        leftist in itself nor particularly compatible with a left politics as
        conventionally understood. At this political juncture, it is, like
        bourgeois feminism and other groupist tendencies, an oppositional
        epicycle <em>within</em> hegemonic neoliberalism, one might say a
        component of neoliberalism&#x2019;s critical self-consciousness; it is
        thus in fact fundamentally <em>anti</em>-leftist. Black political
        elites&#x2019; attacks on the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential

        During the campaign, antiracist activists and commentators routinely
        attacked Sanders for being inattentive to black concerns, which they
        insisted are separate from political economy and capitalist class
        dynamics and reduced to <em>pro forma</em> rehearsal of slogans like
        &#x201C;black lives matter&#x201D; and denunciation of an abstract
        &#x201C;systemic racism.&#x201D; After the 2016 election, antiracist
        hostility toward efforts to generate broadly working class-based,
        social-democratic alternatives to Democratic neoliberalism, if anything,
        intensified. Coates, for example, denounces as white supremacist any
        suggestion that working-class whites&#x2019; votes for Trump stem from
        anything other than commitment to white supremacy.<a

        Social scientists and other public opinion experts have provided steady
        grist for antiracist and other identitiarian ideologues&#x2019;
        incessant rehearsal of the trope of a hopelessly backward, racist,
        sexist, homophobic, and xenophobic white working class as the main
        danger to progress in society. In this insistence, they join Clintonoid
        neoliberal Democrats of all races, genders, and sexual orientations who
        reject downwardly redistributive politics for more openly class-based
        reasons. Thus, as Mark Dudzic points out in a superb essay originally
        written before the election:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Joan Walsh, among many others, opined that Sanders&#x2019; substantial
          support among white workers (who overwhelmingly supported Clinton in
          2008) is because &#x201C;she has been damaged by her association with
          the first black president.&#x201D; And Paul Krugman, that eternal
          guardian of the left gate of the ruling class, pontificated that the
          Sanders campaign failed to understand the importance of
          &#x201C;horizontal inequality&#x201D; between groups.<a

        Dudzic&#x2019;s assessment of liberals&#x2019; reaction to the
        social-democratic enthusiasm Sanders sparked applies equally to
        antiracist activists and commentators:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          The Sanders campaign was so disorienting to both conservatives and
          liberals because it did not embrace these naturalized categories
          [racism and sexism] but, instead, revealed them as social
          relationships established by real human beings and, thus, open to
          change through the application of political and economic policies.
          After stumbling a bit in the early months around how to give voice to
          the outrages of police violence and mass incarceration, it laid out a
          working-class politics of hope that was both visionary and practical.
          In the process, it helped lay bare the actual mechanisms of capitalism
          that drive inequality. And it exposed the fault lines created by
          decades of neoliberalism that are impeding real change in the labor,
          racial justice and other social movements.<a

        Although its attraction to Black Power &#x201C;militancy&#x201D;
        suggests insurgent racial populism, the current race-reductionist
        politics centers on expos&#xE9; and demands for recognition, not
        egalitarian redistribution. Its project is elimination of disparities
        <em>within</em> a regime of intensifying economic inequality, which
        antiracism takes as given. As Warren <em>et al</em>. put it:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Antiracists&#xA0;&#x2026; remain attuned to a vision of justice
          defined by ensuring equal access to hierarchically distributed social
          goods such as family wealth (and redressing historical impediments to
          the accumulation of wealth rooted in discrimination). Indeed in making
          frequent recourse to the adjective &#x201C;narrow&#x201D; in
          chastising a politics that roots inequality in economic exploitation,
          antiracists and identitarians have positioned the idea of racial
          justice as a critique of, rather than an expected consequence of,
          socialism. It is largely for this reason that, as Walter Benn Michaels
          has noted&#xA0;&#x2026; &#x201C;the commitment to identity politics
          has been more an expression of&#xA0;&#x2026; enthusiasm for the free
          market than a form of resistance to it.&#x201D;<a

        Even when its proponents believe themselves to be radicals, this
        antiracist politics is a professional-managerial class politics. Its
        adherents are not concerned with trying to generate the large, broad
        political base needed to pursue a transformative agenda because they are
        committed fundamentally to pursuit of racial parity within
        neoliberalism, not social transformation. In fact, antiracist
        activists&#x2019; and pundits&#x2019; insistence during the 2016
        election campaign that Bernie Sanders did not address black concerns
        made that point very clearly because nearly every item on the Sanders
        campaign&#x2019;s policy agenda&#x2014;from the Robin Hood tax on
        billionaires to free public higher education to the $15/hr minimum wage,
        a single-payer health care system, <em>etc</em>.&#x2014;would
        disproportionately benefit black and Hispanic populations that are
        disproportionately working-class.

      <p>
        Most of all, the gains that black Americans have won have been the
        product of alliances condensed around broad egalitarian agendas.
        Historian Tour&#xE9; F. Reed notes:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          Emancipation and even Reconstruction were produced by a convergence of
          interests among disparate constituencies&#x2014;African Americans,
          abolitionists, business, small freeholders, and northern
          laborers&#x2014;united under the banner of free labor. The civil
          rights movement was the product of a consensus created by the New Deal
          that presumed the appropriateness of government intervention in
          private affairs for the public good, the broad repudiation of
          scientific racism following World War II, and the political
          vulnerabilities Jim Crow created for the United States during the Cold
          War. To be sure, Reconstruction, the New Deal, the War on Poverty, and
          even the civil rights movement failed to redress all of the challenges
          confronting blacks. But the limitations of each of these movements
          reflected political constraints imposed on them, in large part, by
          capital.<a

        That lesson has been lost for many antiracist activists and commentators
        enamored with contemporary race reductionism; instead, they channel the
        performative militancy associated with Black Power politics as the
        insurgent, racially authentic tendency in the late 1960s and 1970s.

        Black Power politics was fundamentally a petition politics, albeit a
        loud and flamboyant one. For all their overheated rhetoric about
        self-determination, including even in some cases what now might be
        called cosplay fantasies of armed struggle, Black Powerites generally
        depended on ruling class largesse for realization of their programmatic
        objectives. That was their alternative to trying to form broad, popular
        coalitions and to navigate the compromises and constraints that sort of
        politics requires. As a practical politics, Black Power was
        fundamentally directed toward government institutions, private or
        philanthropic funding sources, and other agencies capable of conferring
        or ratifying claims to represent a generic &#x201C;black
        community&#x201D; (some referred to the style at the time as
        &#x201C;militant begging&#x201D;; I suppose today it could be considered
        an institutional species of aggressive panhandling). Contemporaneous

        Black Power, at least in the ethnic pluralist form in which it congealed
        as &#x201C;black politics,&#x201D; was at bottom a Bookerite politics of

        It also thus helps to make sense of the affective power that explaining
        current inequalities through analogy to slavery or Jim Crow has in
        antiracist discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Antiracist politics is a class politics; it is rooted in the social
        position and worldview, and material interests of the stratum of race
        relations engineers and administrators who operate in Democratic party
        politics and as government functionaries, the punditry and commentariat,
        education administration and the professoriate, corporate, social
        service and nonprofit sectors, and the multibillion-dollar diversity
        industry. That stratum comes together around a common sense commitment
        to the centrality of race&#x2014;and other categories of ascriptive
        identity&#x2014;as the appropriate discursive framework through which to
        articulate norms of justice and injustice and through which to formulate
        remedial responses. It has grown and become deeply embedded
        institutionally throughout society as an entailment of the victories of
        the 1960s. As society moves further away from the regime of
        subordination and exclusion on explicitly racial terms to which
        race-reductionist explanations were an immediately plausible response,
        race has become less potent as the dominant metaphor, or blanket
        shorthand, through which class hierarchy is lived. And as black and
        white elites increasingly go through the same schools, live in the same
        neighborhoods, operate as peers in integrated workplaces, and share and
        interact in the same social spaces and consumption practices and
        preferences, they increasingly share another common sense, not only
        about frameworks of public policy but about the proper order of things
        in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those quotidian realities put pressure on the reductionist premise that
        racial subordination remains the dominant ideological or material
        framework generating and sustaining systemically reproduced inequalities
        and class power. This tension underlies a source of the appeal of
        ontological views of racism as an animate force that transcends time and
        context. Because it is an evanescent Evil that is disconnected from
        specific human purposes and patterns of social relations, racism, again
        like &#x201C;terrorism,&#x201D; can exist anywhere at any time under any
        manifest conditions and is a cause that needs no causes or explanation.
        That is why statistical demonstration of apparent racial disparities
        seems within antiracist discourse to be self-sufficient evidence of the
        persistence of racism&#x2019;s paramount impact on black Americans,
        despite the fact that findings of disparity: (1) are not surprising
        considering how entrenched inequalities work; (2) do not tell us much,
        if anything, about the proximate sources of the disparities; and (3) do
        not point to remedial responses, although those retailing the findings
        often present them as though they do. As Chowkwanyun and I indicate,
        moreover, relentless commitment to finding disparities, and insistence
        that manifest inequalities be understood in those terms despite those
        interpretive failings, suggests the presence of other ideological
        factors:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

          mind [Thomas] Kuhn&#x2019;s account of attempts to accommodate
          mounting anomalies to salvage an interpretive paradigm in danger of
          crumbling under a crisis of authority. And in this circumstance as
          well the salvage effort is driven by powerful material and ideological
          imperatives.<a

        That ontological view of racism is what enabled Bell&#x2019;s insistence
        that nothing has changed for black Americans since 1865 without having
        to confront the apparently disconfirming evidence of his own biography
        and the context of his declaration. It also underlies the preference for
        invoking historical analogies in lieu of argument. The point of those
        analogies is not to explain the mechanisms through which contemporary
        inequalities are reproduced. It is to preserve the interpretive
        framework that identifies racism as the definitive source of those
        inequalities.

        Antiracism&#x2019;s class character helps to understand why its
        adherents are so intensely committed to it even though it is so deeply
        flawed analytically and has generated so little popular traction
        politically. One layer of its appeal derives simply from habit,
        buttressed with a simulacrum of familiarity engendered by the na&#xEF;ve
        conceptions of black political history that prompted Willie
        Legette&#x2019;s deathless observation that &#x201C;the only thing that
        hasn&#x2019;t changed about black politics since 1965 is how we think

        because that is how scholarly and popular discussion of black

        since the academic study of black politics and political thought took
        shape during the 1950s and 1960s, and especially after the

        mainstream through the 1970s to the 1990s. The guild interest in carving

        Crucial to making sense of the current political moment and how to
        navigate the real perils that face us after November 2016 is recognition
        that, no matter how it may have been aligned in the past, antiracist
        politics now is fundamentally antagonistic to a left politics of broadly
        egalitarian social transformation. Key elements of the black
        professional-managerial strata have been embedded in and are agents and
        minions of what we now call neoliberalism&#x2014;as public
        functionaries, contractors, and aspirants&#x2014;since its emergence in
        the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1980s and 1990s, underclass ideology
        rationalized claims to a special tutelary role for the black
        professional-managerial class in relation to a rank-and-file black
        population that that politics rendered invisible as postal workers,
        teachers, truck drivers, carpenters, clerks, warehouse workers,
        electricians or line workers, nurses, cable technicians, <em>etc</em>.
        or members of a constantly expanding industrial reserve army and
        represented as an undifferentiated mass to be ventriloquized and
        &#x201C;uplifted.&#x201D; Underclass ideology came with a remedy of
        inculcating &#x201C;personal responsibility,&#x201D; which conveniently
        permits public officials to deflect concerns with retreat from social
        service provision and other social wage policies in an era increasingly
        defined by regressive transfer. Neoliberal privatization also has
        produced greatly expanded commercial and career opportunities for black
        (and Latino, female, <em>etc</em>.) entrepreneurs under the rubric of
        community &#x201C;empowerment,&#x201D; &#x201C;role modeling,&#x201D; or
        &#x201C;social entrepreneurialism&#x201D; in a vast third-sector economy
        driven by a nonprofit sector likely as not committed to privatizing
        public goods in the name of localist authenticity and doing well by
        doing good, as well as the steadily growing diversity industry. These
        developments legitimate an ideal of social justice shriveled to little
        more than enhancement of opportunity for individual upward
        mobility&#x2014;within the strictures of neoliberal accumulation by
        dispossession.

        Black professional-managerial class embeddedness has become increasingly
        solidified with the Clinton/Obama/Emanuel wing of the Democratic
        party&#x2019;s aggressive commitment to a left-neoliberalism centered on
        advancement of Wall Street and Silicon Valley economic interests and
        strong support for social justice defined in identity group terms. But
        that is necessarily a notion of social justice and equality that is
        disconnected from political economy and the capitalist class dynamics
        that generate the most profound inequalities in society. And militant
        opposition to conventional left norms of justice that center on economic
        equality unites the Clintonite neoliberal Democrats and
        race-reductionist antiracists. In this regard, the most telling moments
        of the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination campaign included when
        the random, self-selected Black Lives Matter activists attacked Sanders
        for supposedly not declaring his opposition to racism in a way that
        suited their tastes, and when former civil rights movement icon
        Rep.&#xA0;John Lewis (D-GA) and other prominent black functionaries
        denounced Sanders&#x2019;s calls for greatly expanding social wage
        policy and shifting national priorities toward addressing the needs of
        working people as irresponsible. Perhaps most telling of all, though,
        was when, and most of all <em>how</em>, Hillary Clinton blithely and
        disingenuously blew off Sanders&#x2019;s concerns with economic
        injustice. On the eve of the Nevada primary, she declared to a rally of
        her supporters, &#x201C;Not everything is about an economic theory,
        right? If we broke up the big banks tomorrow&#x2014;and I will, if they
        deserve it, if they pose a systemic risk, I will&#x2014;would that end
        racism? Would that end sexism? Would that end discrimination against the
        LGBT community? Would that make people feel more welcoming to immigrants
        overnight? Would that solve our problem with voting rights, and
        Republicans who are trying to strip them away from people of color, the
        elderly, the young?&#x201D;<a

        Since the election, that alliance against class politics has become even
        more aggressive in red-baiting Sanders and the left via a new sort of
        race-baiting&#x2014;attacking socialism, and advocates of socialism or
        social-democratic politics, as racist or white supremacist. It has
        closed ranks around condemnation of working-class whites who voted for
        Trump as loathsome and irredeemable racists with whom political
        solidarity is indefensible and in the process reducing &#x201C;working
        class&#x201D; to a white racial category and synonym for backwardness
        and bigotry. Antiracists and neoliberal Democrats unite in high moral
        dudgeon to denounce suggestions that more than racism operated to
        generate the Trump vote and that some working people, particularly those
        whom Les Leopold describes as Obama/Sanders/Trump voters&#x2014;and not
        necessarily only white ones&#x2014;felt betrayed by both parties.<a

        >
        The practical upshot of that moral stance is that there can be no
        political alternative outside neoliberalism. That is why it is
        important, as we look toward the daunting prospect of building a
        movement capable of changing the terms of debate in American politics to
        center the interests and concerns of working people&#x2014;of all races,
        genders, sexual orientations, and whatever immigration status&#x2014;who
        are the vast majority of the country, that we recognize that
        race-reductionist politics is the left wing of neoliberalism and nothing
        more. It is openly antagonistic to the idea of a solidaristic left. It
        is more important than ever to acknowledge that reality and act
        accordingly.

            The monuments were to the confederate insurrection&#x2019;s
            commanding general, Robert E. Lee; the insurrectionist
            Confederacy&#x2019;s president, Jefferson Davis; rebel general
            P.&#xA0;G.&#xA0;T. Beauregard, who had New Orleans connections; and
            commemoration of the Crescent City White League&#x2019;s armed,
            explicitly racist revolt against the city&#x2019;s Reconstruction
            government. The White League, which was the terrorist face of the
            local Democratic party, represented itself as defending a
            &#x201C;hereditary civilization and Christianity menaced by a stupid
            Africanization,&#x201D; and in 1932 the city added an inscription to
            the commemorative obelisk, erected in 1891, that praised the
            insurrection in explicitly white-supremacist terms. All the
            monuments were erected between 1884 (Lee) and 1915 (Beauregard), the
            precise period of white supremacist consolidation. Reed, Adolph Jr.,
